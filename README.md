### data/

* `Raw_data.csv`: Raw data extracted from the studies. Note that this data has been checked for errors and can be re-used. However, this dataset contains numerous sources of variation, including data having potential procedural concerns (see below)

* `Curated_data.csv`: Curated version of the dataset. This dataset excludes which excludes data having procedural concerns; animals exposed to toxicants, hormones, or high levels of UV radiations; extinct species; and species not described at the species level. We recommend using this dataset to address most questions in ecophysiology.
