TI  - Influence of environment on thermal ecology of direct-developing frogs (Anura: craugastoridae: pristimantis) in the eastern Andes of Colombia
AU  - Castro, Bernal
AB  - Amphibian's temperature is a critical variable in the biology and ecology of organisms, especially ectotherms whose body temperatures depend on environmental conditions. In this study we compared the thermal biology of 13 species of frogs of the genus Pristimantis across 11 sites across different elevations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia, and sought to correlate ecophysiological variation with environmental variation at two scales. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) temperatures of reach frog, along with air temperature, and microhabitat temperature and structure. As the height of the locality increases, CTMin decreases in greater scale in relation to the CTMax, which is high in relation to the maximum temperature reported for highlands. There are also differences in thermal physiology between the flanks of the mountain range. The variables of herbaceous cover, litter cover and Humidity are related to the thermal limits of the species. The changes in thermal physiology include a dynamic that involves not only altitudinal and latitudinal changes, but also the structure and composition of the microhabitats that each species inhabits, as well as the evolutionary history of the species, which can contribute to the conservation of characters such as the CTMax in highland species, which, in turn, raises new questions regarding the survival of species in the face of climate change phenomena.

TI  - Thermal tolerance and sensitivity of amphibian larvae from Palearctic and Neotropical communities
AU  - Katzenberger, Marco
AB  - Amphibians across the world are threatened by climate change. This work deals with the analysis of thermal tolerance and sensitivity and their latitudinal variation at the community level, with the intent of examining the prediction that tropical amphibians are at higher risk of extinction due to global warming than temperate species since their environmental temperatures are closer to their upper thermal limits. To test this prediction, two larval amphibian communities were selected from contrasting latitudes: subtropical (Argentina) and temperate Mediterranean (Iberian Peninsula) climates. In both locations, the following key parameters were obtained: 1) environmental pond temperatures (Thab), by monitoring ponds at different locations using water dataloggers; 2) critical thermal maximum, using a dynamic method called CTmax or knockdown temperature, to assess how close environmental temperatures are from their upper thermal limit; and 3) optimum temperature (Topt), by analysing tadpole’s maximum swimming speed at different temperatures and building thermal performance curves (TPCs), to determine how changes in environmental temperatures will affect the ability to perform ecologically relevant functions and therefore their general fitness. Warming Tolerance (WT) (WT=CTmax-Thab) and Thermal Safety Margins (TSM) (TSM=Topt-Thab) were also calculated for all species. Analyses of CTmax and optimal performance temperature indicate that species have adapted their critical and optimal temperatures to cope with environmental conditions. Species exposed to higher maximum or average temperatures usually have higher CTmax or optimum temperatures, respectively. In addition, there is a significant positive correlation between these traits. Results also show that Argentinean subtropical species, although having higher CTmax and optimum temperature values, have lower WT and narrower TSM. Therefore, these species generally appear to be in greater extinction risk than temperate species from the Iberian Peninsula, under predicted scenarios of rising temperatures and climate change

TI  - Days of futures past : integrating physiology, microenvironments, and biogeographic history to predict response of frogs in neotropical dry-forest to global warming
AU  - Castellanos García, Luisa Alej
AB  - Global climate is changing at an accelerated rate with a predicted increase in temperature of up to 5°C by 2070. Species present in biomes already exposed to high temperatures could be near their thermal limit, and further temperature increase could threaten their survival. Organisms directly experience micro-environments rather than regional temperatures, however. Thus, predicting the response of species to climate change requires understanding how variation in regional temperatures relates to variation in the micro-environment, as well as understanding a species' physiological tolerance to thermal extremes. Finally, understanding how readily a species' thermal niche could evolve to new conditions, is informed by inferring the historical labiality of this trait in a comparative phylogenetic context. We applied this integrative approach to the study of two sympatric frog species (Anura: Leptodactylidae: Leiuperinae) from the xeric lowlands of the Caribbean Coast of South America: the Colombian four-eyed frog, Pleurodema brachyops, and the túngara frog...

TI  - Impact of climate change on Singapore amphibians
AU  - Daniel, NG Jia Jun
AB  - Amphibians are the most threatened of all vertebrate groups and climate change has been partially implicated to their disappearance. Temperature increase and increased rainfall variability are particularly detrimental to them as a result of their unique life history and physiology. Tropical amphibians are especially vulnerable as they are believed to be close to their physiological limits. In my study, I assessed which species are most vulnerable to climate change; determined whether drastic declines are also occurring locally; investigated warming vulnerability between different amphibian communities; ascertained the individual effect of elevated temperature and its interactive effect with low pH. The main findings suggest that while some species may be more tolerant than previously hypothesised, others appear to be vulnerable. In addition, synergistic interaction between high temperature and low pH can reduce survival. These findings will have implications on their future survival and how conservation efforts should be directed towards them.

AU  - Yandún Vela, María Carolina
AB  - Cuando la temperatura ambiental cambia en un ecosistema, los organismos tienen distintas opciones para sobrellevar la modificación. La capacidad de aclimatación es una de ellas. El cambio climático actual puede estar causando declinaciones en las poblaciones de anfibios y el estudio de las tolerancias térmicas de este grupo puede permitir mejorar estrategias de conservación para las especies que se pueden ver más afectadas. En el presente estudio, dos especies de anuros, Rhinella marina y Gastrotheca riobambae, fueron expuestas a distintos tratamientos de aclimatación (14 ºC, 20 ºC, 26 ºC, 32 ºC y 36 ºC) y se obtuvo sus tolerancias térmicas para analizar si estas especies poseen capacidad de aclimatación, calculada mediante el Radio de Respuesta de Aclimatación (ARR), y evaluar su vulnerabilidad relativa al cambio climático. Los resultados mostraron una respuesta de aclimatación positiva para ambas especies, R. marina tuvo un ARRMAX=0.2 que indica que tiene más capacidad de aclimatación hacia el calor que G. riobambae con ARRMAX=0.12. Para el ARRMIN, el resultado fue mayor aclimatación para el frío de G. riobambae. Esta especie mostró también tener el rango de tolerancia más amplio con 40 grados de amplitud térmica, y menor vulnerabilidad relativa al cambio climático con WT=23.6 grados.

AB  - Temperature and water availability are factors that affect, importantly, the ecology, physiology, and behavior of amphibians. In this sense, these animals need to present a number of ecophysiological characteristics that allows them to cope with potentially challenging environmental features. In this thesis, I aimed to explore different topics (ecological gradients, diseases, and activity) focusing on the thermal physiology and water balance of anuran amphibians. The first chapter presents a general introduction focused on one of the central themes of this thesis, the thermal physiology of amphibians. However, this chapter also explores the inter-relationship between body temperature regulation and water balance. The second chapter investigates whether or not physiological traits associated to thermal tolerances and water balance, in five anuran amphibians, vary along elevational gradients along two mountain ranges, Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira, in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The third chapter examines the potential effects of chytridomycosis - an emerging fungal disease claimed to cause amphibian population declines and extinctions worldwide due to cutaneous osmoregulatory disorders - on the water balance and mortality of anuran species from Brazil. The fourth chapter investigates whether or not the diurnal activity of dispersing juveniles of the burrowing frog, Dermatonotus muelleri, might be correlated with physiological traits associated to thermal physiology and water balance

AB  - We provide data to support the onset of spasms (OS) as the definitive end point for determining thermal tolerance with the critical thermal maximum (CTMax). We measured the CTMax of 610 animals in three vertebrate classes, Actinopterygii, Amphibia, and Reptilia. All showed a significantly lower mean loss of righting response (LRR) than OS. Statistical evaluation of the variability associated with the end points LRR and OS also showed that OS is a more precise measure of thermal tolerance. OS is a more meaningful end point than LRR because it more closely fits the original definition of the critical thermal maximum (R.B. Cowles and C.M. Bogeft. 1944. Bull. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist. 83:261-296) and Occurs at temperatures required for physiological responses, such as heat-hardening and perhaps the production of some heat-shock proteins. The adoption of OS as a standard end point would allow valid comparisons of data from different studies and among taxa, an important consideration for comparative phylogenetic analyses. However, we suggest that LRR should also be measured for comparisons with data from earlier studies.

AB  - Extreme weather events, such as unusually hot or dry conditions, can cause death by exceeding physiological limits, and so cause loss of population. Survival will depend on whether or not susceptible organisms can find refuges that buffer extreme conditions. Microhabitats offer different microclimates to those found within the wider ecosystem, but do these microhabitats effectively buffer extreme climate events relative to the physiological requirements of the animals that frequent them? We collected temperature data from four common microhabitats (soil, tree holes, epiphytes, and vegetation) located from the ground to canopy in primary rainforests in the Philippines. Ambient temperatures were monitored from outside of each microhabitat and from the upper forest canopy, which represent our macrohabitat controls. We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of frog and lizard species, which are thermally sensitive and inhabit our microhabitats. Microhabitats reduced mean temperature by 1-2 °C and reduced the duration of extreme temperature exposure by 14-31 times. Microhabitat temperatures were below the CTmax of inhabitant frogs and lizards, whereas macrohabitats consistently contained lethal temperatures. Microhabitat temperatures increased by 0.11-0.66 °C for every 1 °C increase in macrohabitat temperature, and this nonuniformity in temperature change influenced our forecasts of vulnerability for animal communities under climate change. Assuming uniform increases of 6 °C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 32-fold, whereas under nonuniform increases of 0.66 to 3.96 °C, microhabitats decreased the vulnerability of communities by up to 108-fold. Microhabitats have extraordinary potential to buffer climate and likely reduce mortality during extreme climate events. These results suggest that predicted changes in distribution due to mortality and habitat shifts that are derived from macroclimatic samples and that assume uniform changes in microclimates relative to macroclimates may be overly pessimistic. Nevertheless, even nonuniform temperature increases within buffered microhabitats would still threaten frogs and lizards. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Predicting the biodiversity impacts of global warming implies that we know where and with what magnitude these impacts will be encountered. Amphibians are currently the most threatened vertebrates, mainly due to habitat loss and to emerging infectious diseases. Global warming may further exacerbate their decline in the near future, although the impact might vary geographically. We predicted that subtropical amphibians should be relatively susceptible to warming-induced extinctions because their upper critical thermal limits (CT max) might be only slightly higher than maximum pond temperatures (T max). We tested this prediction by measuring CT max and T max for 47 larval amphibian species from two thermally distinct subtropical communities (the warm community of the Gran Chaco and the cool community of Atlantic Forest, northern Argentina), as well as from one European temperate community. Upper thermal tolerances of tadpoles were positively correlated (controlling for phylogeny) with maximum pond temperatures, although the slope was steeper in subtropical than in temperate species. CT max values were lowest in temperate species and highest in the subtropical warm community, which paradoxically, had very low warming tolerance (CT max-T max) and therefore may be prone to future local extinction from acute thermal stress if rising pond T max soon exceeds their CT max. Canopy-protected subtropical cool species have larger warming tolerance and thus should be less impacted by peak temperatures. Temperate species are relatively secure to warming impacts, except for late breeders with low thermal tolerance, which may be exposed to physiological thermal stress in the coming years. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - It is often assumed that ecological interactions happen at rapid rates relative to evolutionary change. In this study we examined the development and physiology of an amphibian (Rana sylvatica) from populations found in forested wetlands, and from wetlands that had been cleared by reinvading beaver (Castor canadensis). Embryos from beaver wetlands hatched at lower rates when raised in a shaded, common garden setting compared with embryos from forested wetlands. Larvae from beaver wetlands had higher critical thermal maxima compared with conspecifics from forested wetlands. These patterns suggest that R. sylvatica populations may have diverged rapidly (in less than 36 years) in response to changes in their environment induced by another species. Other agents of thermal change, such as anthropogenic landscape conversion or alteration of global Climate, could have analogous impacts on wetland dependent species such as amphibians.

T2  - Conservation Biology
AB  - Rising temperatures, a widespread consequence of climate change, have been implicated in enigmatic amphibian declines from habitats with little apparent human impact. The pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), now widespread in Neotropical mountains, may act in synergy with climate change causing collapse in thermally stressed hosts. We measured the thermal tolerance of frogs along a wide elevational gradient in the Tropical Andes, where frog populations have collapsed. We used the difference between critical thermal maximum and the temperature a frog experiences in nature as a measure of tolerance to high temperatures. Temperature tolerance increased as elevation increased, suggesting that frogs at higher elevations may be less sensitive to rising temperatures. We tested the alternative pathogen optimal growth hypothesis that prevalence of the pathogen should decrease as temperatures fall outside the optimal range of pathogen growth. Our infection-prevalence data supported the pathogen optimal growth hypothesis because we found that prevalence of Bd increased when host temperatures matched its optimal growth range. These findings suggest that rising temperatures may not be the driver of amphibian declines in the eastern slopes of the Andes. Zoonotic outbreaks of Bd are the most parsimonious hypothesis to explain the collapse of montane amphibian faunas; but our results also reveal that lowland tropical amphibians, despite being shielded from Bd by higher temperatures, are vulnerable to climate-warming stress. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.

AB  - Human activities often replace native forests with warmer, modified habitats that represent novel thermal environments for biodiversity. Reducing biodiversity loss hinges upon identifying which species are most sensitive to the environmental conditions that result from habitat modification. Drawing on case studies and a meta-analysis, we examined whether observed and modelled thermal traits, including heat tolerances, variation in body temperatures, and evaporative water loss, explained variation in sensitivity of ectotherms to habitat modification. Low heat tolerances of lizards and amphibians and high evaporative water loss of amphibians were associated with increased sensitivity to habitat modification, often explaining more variation than non-thermal traits. Heat tolerances alone explained 24–66% (mean = 38%) of the variation in species responses, and these trends were largely consistent across geographic locations and spatial scales. As habitat modification alters local microclimates, the thermal biology of species will likely play a key role in the reassembly of terrestrial communities. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS

T2  - Global Change Biology
AB  - Habitat conversion is a major driver of the biodiversity crisis, yet why some species undergo local extinction while others thrive under novel conditions remains unclear. We suggest that focusing on species' niches, rather than traits, may provide the predictive power needed to forecast biodiversity change. We first examine two Neotropical frog congeners with drastically different affinities to deforestation and document how thermal niche explains deforestation tolerance. The more deforestation-tolerant species is associated with warmer macroclimates across Costa Rica, and warmer microclimates within landscapes. Further, in laboratory experiments, the more deforestation-tolerant species has critical thermal limits, and a jumping performance optimum, shifted ~2 °C warmer than those of the more forest-affiliated species, corresponding to the ~3 °C difference in daytime maximum temperature that these species experience between habitats. Crucially, neither species strictly specializes on either habitat - instead habitat use is governed by regional environmental temperature. Both species track temperature along an elevational gradient, and shift their habitat use from cooler forest at lower elevations to warmer deforested pastures upslope. To generalize these conclusions, we expand our analysis to the entire mid-elevational herpetological community of southern Costa Rica. We assess the climatological affinities of 33 amphibian and reptile species, showing that across both taxonomic classes, thermal niche predicts presence in deforested habitat as well as or better than many commonly used traits. These data suggest that warm-adapted species carry a significant survival advantage amidst the synergistic impacts of land-use conversion and climate change. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Land-cover and climate change are both expected to alter species distributions and contribute to future biodiversity loss. However, the combined effects of land-cover and climate change on assemblages, especially at the landscape scale, remain understudied. Lowland tropical amphibians may be particularly susceptible to changes in land cover and climate warming because many species have narrow thermal safety margins resulting from air and body temperatures that are close to their critical thermal maxima (CTmax). We examined how changing thermal landscapes may alter the area of thermally suitable habitat (TSH) for tropical amphibians. We measured microclimates in 6 land-cover types and CTmax of 16 frog species in lowland northeastern Costa Rica. We used a biophysical model to estimate core body temperatures of frogs exposed to habitat-specific microclimates while accounting for evaporative cooling and behavior. Thermally suitable habitat area was estimated as the portion of the landscape where species CTmax exceeded their habitat-specific maximum body temperatures. We projected changes in TSH area 80 years into the future as a function of land-cover change only, climate change only, and combinations of land-cover and climate-change scenarios representing low and moderate rates of change. Projected decreases in TSH area ranged from 16% under low emissions and reduced forest loss to 30% under moderate emissions and business-as-usual land-cover change. Under a moderate emissions scenario (A1B), climate change alone contributed to 1.7- to 4.5-fold greater losses in TSH area than land-cover change only, suggesting that future decreases in TSH from climate change may outpace structural habitat loss. Forest-restricted species had lower mean CTmax than species that occurred in altered habitats, indicating that thermal tolerances will likely shape assemblages in changing thermal landscapes. In the face of ongoing land-cover and climate change, it will be critical to consider changing thermal landscapes in strategies to conserve ectotherm species. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology

AB  - Aim: Under the Hutchinsonian concept of the realized niche, biotic interactions and dispersal limitation may prevent species from fully occupying areas that they could tolerate physiologically. This can hamper the translation of physiological limits into climatically defined range limits and distorts inferences of evolutionary changes of the adaptive limits (i.e. niche conservatism). In contrast, heritable physiological limits should conform more closely to the position of the niche in the climatic hyperspace. Here, we hypothesize that a measure of niche position in the climatic hyperspace is more reliable than niche boundaries to capture the variability and evolutionary pattern of physiological tolerance. Location: Neotropics and Palaeartic. Methods: We used phylogenetic and non-phylogenetic regressions to test the relationships between physiological requirements and macroecological niche features (i.e. based on known species distributions) among anurans. We use larval critical thermal maximum (CTmax) as a measure of physiological response and maximum temperature (Tmax), temperature variability (Tvar) and the position and breadth of niche in climatic hyperspace as measures of the realized niche in geographical space. We also compare evolutionary rates among these parameters using the phylogenetic signal representation curve. Results: CTmax is better correlated with niche position (r2=0.414) than with Tvar, and CTmax is unrelated to either Tmax or niche breadth. CTmax and macroecological niche position also show similar and rapid evolutionary rates, i.e. faster than Brownian motion, whereas Tmax and Tvar evolve more slowly and niche breadth evolves at random. Main conclusions: The transferability between thermal tolerance and realized climatic niche limits is weak. Only macroecological niche position in the multivariate climatic hyperspace correlates with physiological tolerance. It thus appears to be more suitable for describing the variability and evolutionary pattern of the species' adaptive limits. We link these results to 'niche dimensionality', in that multiple interacting factors outweigh single factors in demarcating the species' realized climatic niche, thereby determining the conserved upper thermal limits of the species. © 2013 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.

AB  - Species may circumvent the impacts of climate warming if the habitats they use reduce ambient temperature. In this study, we identified which frog species from a tropical montane rain forest in the Philippines may be vulnerable to climate warming. To do so, we selected five anuran species that utilize four breeding habitats and identified the sensitivity and exposure of tadpoles and direct-developer eggs to heat by measuring their critical thermal maximums (CTmax) and the habitat-specific temperatures they experience. Our study species included two direct-developer frogs-one species that lays its eggs on exposed leaves, and another that lays its eggs in ferns-and three species that produce aquatic free-swimming tadpoles-two stream breeders, and one phytotelm (tree hole) breeder. We compared thermal tolerances derived from microclimates of breeding habitats with tolerances derived from macroclimate (i.e., non-buffered air temperature taken from the rain forest canopy). We also examined whether differences in CTmax existed across life-history stages (egg, metamorph/young-of-year, and adult) for the two direct-developer frog species. Habitats buffered ambient temperature and expanded thermal tolerances of all frog species. We found that direct-developers, however, are more vulnerable to increased temperatures than aquatic breeders-indicated by their high sensitivity to temperature, and exposure to high temperatures. Direct-developer eggs were more sensitive to warming than both metamorph and adult life-history stages. Thermally buffered microhabitats may represent the only protection against current and impending climate warming. Our data highlight the importance of considering sensitivity and exposure in unison when deciphering warming vulnerability of frogs. © 2013 Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation Inc.

AB  - Aim: The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) states that a positive relationship may exist between the breadth of thermal tolerance range and the level of climatic variability experienced by taxa with increasing latitude, especially in terrestrial ectotherms. Under CVH, we expected to find a correspondence between both thermal tolerance limits (CTmax and CTmin), ambient extreme temperature and the range sizes of species. We examined the validity of these predictions in a lowland tropical and a temperate tadpole assemblage. Location: Lowland Neotropics (Bahia, Brazil) and Palaearctic (Iberian Peninsula and North Africa). Method: We employed phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) and Pagel's lambda to analyse phylogenetic signals in CTmax and CTmin. We used phylogenetic regression analyses (PGLS) to test the relationships between thermal limits, range size and temperature predictors (measured at the macroscale and microhabitat levels) and phy-ANOVA to compare both the physiological traits and thermal regimen in both tropical and temperate assemblages. Results: We documented moderate-to-strong phylogenetic signal in both heat and cold tolerance. Temperate-zone tadpoles had broader thermal tolerances than tropical ones. Thermal tolerance range was correlated with range sizes and was explained by seasonal thermal range predictors at the global scale. Both macro- and microclimate temperature variables provided the best predictive multivariate models of thermal limits at the global scale. Microclimatic predictors, however, were the main determinants of CTmax and CTmin variation at the local level of tropical and temperate communities respectively. Main conclusions: Thermal tolerance range increases with latitude in tadpoles due to the higher increase in cold tolerance in temperate tadpoles. At the global scale, both macro- and microenvironment thermal information were reliable predictors of critical thermal limits and thermal tolerance range, as CVH predicts. However, thermal limits were best predicted by temperatures of the micro-habitat at the regional level, thus suggesting that physiological thermal boundaries may be governed by thermal selection. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Although temperature variation is known to cause large-scale adaptive divergence, its potential role as a selective factor over microgeographic scales is less well-understood. Here, we investigated how variation in breeding pond temperature affects divergence in multiple physiological (thermal performance curve and critical thermal maximum [CTmax]) and life-history (thermal developmental reaction norms) traits in a network of Rana arvalis populations. The results supported adaptive responses to face two main constraints limiting the evolution of thermal adaptation. First, we found support for the faster-slower model, indicating an adaptive response to compensate for the thermodynamic constraint of low temperatures in colder environments. Second, we found evidence for the generalist-specialist trade-off with populations from colder and less thermally variable environments exhibiting a specialist phenotype performing at higher rates but over a narrower range of temperatures. By contrast, the local optimal temperature for locomotor performance and CTmax did not match either mean or maximum pond temperatures. These results highlight the complexity of the adaptive multiple-trait thermal responses in natural populations, and the role of local thermal variation as a selective force driving diversity in life-history and physiological traits in the presence of gene flow. © 2015, Society for the Study of Evolution.

AB  - Diurnal activity is characteristic of many toad species, including Bufo granulosus from the Brazilian semi-arid biome called the Caatinga. Because of their patterns of activity, juvenile toads are exposed to hot and dehydrating conditions. Our investigation focuses on temperature and water relationships, and is based on the prediction that anuran diurnal activity in a semi-arid environment must be associated with morphological, physiological and behavioral traits enhancing thermal tolerances, capacity for performance at high temperatures and water balance. To test specific hypothesis related with this prediction, we investigated postmetamorphic B. granulosus and collected data on thermal tolerances and preferences, thermal safety margins, thermal dependence of locomotor behavior, thermal and kinetic properties of citrate synthase (CS), and skin morphophysiology. This information was compared with additional data from adult conspecifics and adult toads from sympatric species or from species from more moderate environments. We found that juvenile B. granulosus exhibit the highest critical maximum temperature reported for toads (44.2 °C) and are well suited to move at high temperatures. However, and in contrast with juveniles of other Bufo species, they do not show thermal preferences in a gradient and appear to hydroregulate more than thermoregulate. The CS of adult and juvenile toads shows typical patterns of thermal sensibility, but the thermal stability of this enzyme is much higher in juveniles than in adult Bufo of any other species studied. The inguinal skin exhibits a complex folding pattern and seems highly specialized for capillary water uptake. Diurnal activity in juvenile B. granulosus is possible given high thermal tolerances, keen ability to detect and uptake water, and avoidance behaviors. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Photoperiod acclimation and 24-hour variations in the critical thermal maxima of a tropical and a temperate frog
AU  - Mahoney, J.J.
AU  - Hutchison, V.H.
T2  - Oecologia
AB  - The effect of photoperiod on the upper thermal tolerance of two species of frogs was studied by using the critical thermal maximum (CTM) as the end point. Both species are heliotropic and from temperate climates, but Hyla labialis lives under a near constant tropical photoperiod while Rana pipiens lives under a varying temperatezone photoperiod. The CTM of both species was studied over a 24-hour period to determine if a rhythm of temperature tolerance exists. In all but one of the acclimatization conditions used, the CTM of R. pipiens was higher than that of H. labialis. This agrees with what is known of their thermal ecology. Photoperiod significantly affects the CTM of both species. For Rana pipiens long (LD 16:8) photoperiods result in significantly higher thermal tolerance than short (LD 8:16) or moderate (LD 12:12) photoperiods at both 15 and 25° C. H. labialis shows a different pattern, having highest CTM at 25°C, LD 12:12 and lowest at 15°C, LD 12:12. When acclimated to a short (LD 8:16) photoperiod certain aspects of the frogs' tolerance of high temperatures are altered. At the same acclimatization the CTM of R. pipiens is higher than that of H. labialis, except under a combination short light regime and low temperature, and H. labialis at LD 8:16 shows no thermal acclimation between 15 and 25°C. Significant variation in the CTM over a 24-hour period occurred in H. labialis acclimatized at 25°C, LD 12:12 and R. pipiens at 25°C, LD 8:16 and 15°C, LD 12:12. For both species the 24-hour rhythm of temperature tolerance, when it occurs at LD 12:12, might be of adaptive value. Times of highest thermal tolerance are in the late morning or early afternoon and lowest tolerance is during the dark period. For R. pipiens under the unnatural combination of 25°C, LD 8:16, the pattern is reversed. When all three significant cycles are phase shifted so that the times of highest tolerance coincide, the pattern of the curves is very similar. © 1969 Springer-Verlag.

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - Tropical ectothermic species are currently depicted as more vulnerable to increasing temperatures because of the proximity between their upper thermal limits and environmental temperatures. Yet, the acclimatory capacity of thermal limits has rarely been measured in tropical species, even though they are generally predicted to be smaller than in temperate species. We compared critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and warming tolerance (WT: the difference between CTmax and maximum temperature, Tmax), as well as CTmax acclimatory capacity of toad species from the Atlantic forest (AF) and the Brazilian Caatinga (CAA), a semi-arid habitat with high temperatures. Acclimation temperatures represented the mean temperatures of AF and CAA habitats, making estimates of CTmax and WT more ecologically realistic. CAA species mean CTmax was higher compared to AF species in both acclimation treatments. Clutches within species, as well as between AF and CAA species, differed in CTmax plasticity and we discuss the potential biological meaning of these findings. We did not find a trade-off between absolute CTmax and CTmax plasticity, indicating that species can have both high CTmax and high CTmax plasticity. Although CTmax was highly correlated to Tmax, CTmax plasticity was not related to Tmax or Tmax coefficients of variation. CAA species mean WT was lower than for AF species, but still very high for all species, diverging from other studies with tropical species. This might be partially related to over-estimation of vulnerability due to under-appreciation of realistic acclimation treatments in CTmax estimation. Thus, some tropical species might not be as vulnerable to warming as previously predicted if CTmax is considered as a shifting population parameter. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We measured the critical thermal maxima (CTMax) of tadpoles of Buergeria japonica inhabiting streams and geothermal hot springs. The CTMax of all B. japonica tadpoles was over 41 C, indicating that the tadpoles are heat-tolerant. At Rushan, we monitored the temporal and spatial distribution of tadpoles over a 24-h period in a 220 cm X 70 cm plot that is fed by a geothermal hot spring. The thermal profiles of the plot varied seasonally, but the highest water temperature selected by tadpoles remained similar (ca. 37 C). In the winter, the thermal range of the plot was lower (29.5-40.6 C), and tadpoles could be found in the majority of the plot. In contrast, during the spring and summer the temperature ranges of the plot were higher (33.1-43.8 C and 33.0-42.4 C, respectively), and tadpoles could be found only in the cooler sections of the plot, especially around 1000 h with direct solar radiation. These results suggest that extreme heat tolerance and behavioral thermoregulation (i.e., heat avoidance behavior) are the main means by which B. japonica tadpoles cope with the high temperatures in geothermal hot springs. © 2005 by The Herpetologists' League, Inc.

AB  - Despite many studies demonstrating the effect of acclimation on behavioural or physiological traits, considerable debate still exists about the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon. One of the unresolved issues is whether acclimation to warmer temperature is beneficial at treatment or at more extreme test temperatures. To answer this question, we assessed the effect of thermal acclimation on preferred body temperatures (Tps), maximum swimming and running speed, and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in the Danube crested newt (Triturus dobrogicus). Adult newts were kept at 15°C (control) and 25°C (treatment) for 8 weeks prior to measurements. We measured Tps in an aquatic thermal gradient over 24 h, maximum speeds in a linear racetrack at six temperatures (5-33°C), and CTmax in a continuously heated water bath. Tps were higher in newts kept at 15°C than in those kept at 25°C. The maximum swimming speed did not acclimate. The maximum running speed at 30-33°C was substantially higher in newts kept at 25°C than in those kept at 15°C. CTmax increased with the treatment temperature. Hence, we conclude that the acclimation response to warm temperature is beneficial not at treatment but at more extreme temperatures in newts. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.

AB  - Rate of evaporation, resistance to drying, temperature selection, and critical thermal maximum were measured for Jamaican Eleutherodactylus acclimated to 20° C and a 12:12 L:D photoperiod. Two introduced species, E. planirostris and E. johnstonei, selected higher temperatures and had higher CTMs than two native species, E. cundalli and E. gossei. The introduced species lost water as rapidly as the native species, but tolerated 30-73% greater water loss before losing their righting response. The physiological differences are reflected in the microhabitat selection and activity patterns of the four species. © 1977 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Critical thermal limits are thought to be correlated with the elevational distribution of species living in tropical montane regions, but with upper limits being relatively invariant compared to lower limits. To test this hypothesis, we examined the variation of thermal physiological traits in a group of terrestrial breeding frogs (Craugastoridae) distributed along a tropical elevational gradient. We measured the critical thermal maximum (CTmax; n = 22 species) and critical thermal minimum (CTmin; n = 14 species) of frogs captured between the Amazon floodplain (250 m asl) and the high Andes (3,800 m asl). After inferring a multilocus species tree, we conducted a phylogenetically informed test of whether body size, body mass, and elevation contributed to the observed variation in CTmax and CTmin along the gradient. We also tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of change given that critical thermal limits (and their plasticity) may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints along the gradient. Variation of critical thermal traits was significantly correlated with species’ elevational midpoint, their maximum and minimum elevations, as well as the maximum air temperature and the maximum operative temperature as measured across this gradient. Both thermal limits showed substantial variation, but CTmin exhibited relatively faster rates of change than CTmax, as observed in other taxa. Nonetheless, our findings call for caution in assuming inflexibility of upper thermal limits and underscore the value of collecting additional empirical data on species’ thermal physiology across elevational gradients. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - 1. 1. The tailed frog is a stenotopic anuran found only in cold mountain stream habitats, whereas the Pacific treefrog is found in a wide variety of habitats which are thermally diverse. 2. 2. The critical thermal maximum (CTM) for Hyla regilla is significantly above that of Ascaphus truei at all acclimation temperatures. 3. 3. The incipient lethal temperature (ILT) for H. regilla is about 9°C higher than the corresponding value for A. truei. 4. 4. A truei tends to select a lower temperature in a thermal gradient than does H. regilla. 5. 5. These observed physiological and behavioral differences correlate well with the differences between the habitats of these two anuran species. © 1973.

AB  - Although the skin of most amphibians measured to date offers no resistance to evaporative water loss (EWL), some species, primarily arboreal frogs, produce skin secretions that increase resistance to EWL. At high air temperatures, it may be advantageous for amphibians to increase EWL as a means to decrease body temperature. In Australian hylid frogs, most species do not decrease their resistance at high air temperature, but some species with moderate resistance (at moderate air temperatures) gradually decrease resistance with increasing air temperature, and some species with high resistance (at moderate air temperatures) abruptly decrease resistance at high air temperatures. Lower skin resistance at high air temperatures decreases the time to desiccation, but the lower body temperatures allow the species to avoid their critical thermal maximum (CTMax) body temperatures. The body temperatures of species with low to moderate resistances to EWL that do not adjust resistance at high air temperatures do not warm to their CTMax, although for some species, this is because they have high CTMax values. As has been reported previously for resistance to EWL generally, the response pattern of change of EWL at high air temperatures has apparently evolved independently among Australian hylids. The mechanisms involved in causing resistance and changes in resistance are unknown. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - When dispersal is not an option to evade warming temperatures, compensation through behavior, plasticity, or evolutionary adaptation is essential to prevent extinction. In this work, we evaluated whether there is physiological plasticity in the thermal performance curve (TPC) of maximum jumping speed in individuals acclimated to current and projected temperatures and whether there is an opportunity for behavioral thermoregulation in the desert landscape where inhabits the northernmost population of the endemic frog Pleurodema thaul. Our results indicate that individuals acclimated to 20°C and 25°C increased the breath of their TPCs by shifting their upper limits with respect to when they were acclimated at 10°C. In addition, even when dispersal is not possible for this population, the landscape is heterogeneous enough to offer opportunities for behavioral thermoregulation. In particular, under current climatic conditions, behavioral thermoregulation is not compulsory as available operative temperatures are encompassed within the population TPC limits. However, for severe projected temperatures under climate change, behavioral thermoregulation will be required in the sunny patches. In overall, our results suggest that this population of Pleurodema thaul will be able to endure the worst projected scenario of climate warming as it has not only the physiological capacities but also the environmental opportunities to regulate its body temperature behaviorally. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - We compared the reproductive phenology and tadpole thermal physiology of two populations of Buergeria japonica in Taiwan. The population in Jentse breeds in a geothermal hot spring whose water is a warm, over 35°C year-round, whereas the population in Chukou breeds in a stream whose water temperature is closely correlated with fluctuations in air temperature and averages 23°C. The B. japonica population in Jentse breeds year-round, but the Chukou population breeds only from March to October. Tadpoles from Jentse that reared at 32°C attained larger sizes than tadpoles from Chukou that reared at 32°C, whereas tadpoles from both sites attained similar body size when reared at 22°C. Chukou tadpoles reared at 40°C died within 1-2 d, whereas Jentse tadpoles survived for 9 d at 40°C. All tadpoles tolerated heat well, but Jentse tadpoles had higher critical thermal maxima (CTMax) than Chukou tadpoles. Tadpoles from Jentse showed no metabolic compensation but those from Chukou showed an "inverse" metabolic compensation. Results suggest that B. japonica that breed in the geothermal hot spring has a prolonged breeding season, high growth rates and the reduction or absence of intra-and inter-specific competition. Evolution of a high level of heat tolerance and, possibly, behavioral temperature selection, enable tadpoles in the hotsprings to offset the thermal stress imposed by warm water.

The desiccation tolerance of the introduced tropical toad Bufo marinus is similar to other terrestrial anuran amphibians (52·6 per cent of total body water), while the resistance to the hydration stress of distilled water is that of an aquatic anuran. 2. 2. The critical thermal maxima of ca. 40°C for adults and 42°C for larvae are high enough so that high ambient temperatures are not limiting. 3. 3. The lower temperature limit (below 10°C) permits continued survival in its present South Florida range, but shifting of this limit must occur before the range can expand into temperate Florida. © 1970.

AB  - To forecast biological responses to changing environments, we need to understand how a species's physiology varies through space and time and assess how changes in physiological function due to environmental changes may interact with phenotypic changes caused by other types of environmental variation. Amphibian larvae are well known for expressing environmentally induced phenotypes, but relatively little is known about how these responses might interact with changing temperatures and their thermal physiology. To address this question, we studied the thermal physiology of grey treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) by determining whether exposures to predator cues and an herbicide (Roundup) can alter their critical maximum temperature (CTmax) and their swimming speed across a range of temperatures, which provides estimates of optimal temperature (Topt) for swimming speed and the shape of the thermal performance curve (TPC). We discovered that predator cues induced a 0.4°C higher CTmax value, whereas the herbicide had no effect. Tadpoles exposed to predator cues or the herbicide swam faster than control tadpoles and the increase in burst speed was higher near Topt. In regard to the shape of the TPC, exposure to predator cues increased Topt by 1.5°C, while exposure to the herbicide marginally lowered Topt by 0.4°C. Combining predator cues and the herbicide produced an intermediate Topt that was 0.5°C higher than the control. To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate a predator altering the thermal physiology of amphibian larvae (prey) by increasing CTmax, increasing the optimum temperature, and producing changes in the thermal performance curves. Furthermore, these plastic responses of CTmax and TPC to different inducing environments should be considered when forecasting biological responses to global warming. © 2014 Katzenberger et al.

The CTM of progressively larger (older) postmetamorphic or juvenile toads gradually increases until the adult CTM of 41.1°C is attained. 3. 3. This gradual increase in CTM from juvenile to adult toad suggests that the physiological systems underlying thermal tolerance change or mature following metamorphosis until the adult condition is reached. 4. 4.

AB  - 1. 1. Metabolic rate and critical thermal maximum (CTM) were studied in three groups of carpenter frogs, Rana virgatipes, acclimated to 5, 15 and 25°C, respectively. 2. 2. Metabolic rate increased with test temperature in all acclimation groups and, over the range of temperatures tested (5-25°C), Q10 was positively correlated with acclimation temperature. 3. 3. Acclimation produced no statistically significant differences in the metabolic performance of the three groups at test temperatures of 5 and 15 °C; at 25°C, the group acclimated to that temperature had a significantly higher rate of metabolism than the other two groups. 4. 4. CTM varied directly with acclimation temperature and was significantly different among the three groups. 5. 5. The inconsistency between metabolic rate data and CTM data as indices of thermal acclimation suggests that the physiological adjustments which mediate acclimation in one process are not identical to those which induce acclimation in the other. © 1973.

TI  - Low thermal tolerances of stream amphibians in the Pacific Northwest: Implications for riparian and forest management

T2  - Applied Herpetology
AB  - Temperature has a profound effect on survival and ecology of amphibians. In the Pacific Northwest, timber harvest is known to increase peak stream temperatures to 24°C or higher, which has potential to negatively impact cold-water stream amphibians. I determined the Critical Thermal Maxima (CT max) for two salamanders that are endemic to the Pacific Northwest. Rhyacotriton variegatus larvae acclimated at 10°C had mean CTmax of 26.7 ± 0.7 SD°C and adults acclimated at 11°C had mean CT max of 27.9 ± 1.1°C. These were among the lowest known values for any amphibian. Values were significantly higher for larval Dicamptodon tenebrosus acclimated at 14°C (x = 29.1 ± 0.2°C). Although the smallest R. variegatus had some of the lowest values, size of larvae and adults did not influence CTmax in this species. Current forest practices retain riparian buffers along larger fish-bearing streams; however, such buffers along smaller headwaters and non-fish bearing streams may provide favorable habitat conditions for coldwater-associated species in the Pacific Northwest. The current study lends further evidence to the need for protection of Northwest stream amphibians from environmental perturbations. Forest guidelines that include riparian buffer zones and configurations of upland stands should be developed, while monitoring amphibian responses to determine their success. © 2008 Brill Academic Publishers.

TI  - Low acclimation capacity of narrow-ranging thermal specialists exposes susceptibility to global climate change
AU  - Markle, T.M.

T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Thermal acclimation is hypothesized to offer a selective advantage in seasonal habitats and may underlie disparities in geographic range size among closely-related species with similar ecologies. Understanding this relationship is also critical for identifying species that are more sensitive to warming climates. Here, we study North American plethodontid salamanders to investigate whether acclimation ability is associated with species’ latitudinal extents and the thermal range of the environments they inhabit. We quantified variation in thermal physiology by measuring standard metabolic rate (SMR) at different test and acclimation temperatures for 16 species of salamanders with varying latitudinal extents. A phylogenetically-controlled Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model (MCMCglmm) was then employed to determine whether there are differences in SMR between wide- and narrow-ranging species at different acclimation temperatures. In addition, we tested for a relationship between the acclimation ability of species and the environmental temperature ranges they inhabit. Further, we investigated if there is a trade-off between critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and thermal acclimation ability. MCMCglmm results show a significant difference in acclimation ability between wide and narrow-ranging temperate salamanders. Salamanders with wide latitudinal distributions maintain or slightly increase SMR when subjected to higher test and acclimation temperatures, whereas several narrow-ranging species show significant metabolic depression. We also found significant, positive relationships between acclimation ability and environmental thermal range, and between acclimation ability and CTMax. Wide-ranging salamander species exhibit a greater capacity for thermal acclimation than narrow-ranging species, suggesting that selection for acclimation ability may have been a key factor enabling geographic expansion into areas with greater thermal variability. Further, given that narrow-ranging salamanders are found to have both poor acclimation ability and lower tolerance to warm temperatures, they are likely to be more susceptible to environmental warming associated with anthropogenic climate change. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Unprecedented global climate change and increasing rates of infectious disease emergence are occurring simultaneously. Infection with emerging pathogens may alter the thermal thresholds of hosts. However, the effects of fungal infection on host thermal limits have not been examined. Moreover, the influence of infections on the heat tolerance of hosts has rarely been investigated within the context of realistic thermal acclimation regimes and potential anthropogenic climate change. We tested for effects of fungal infection on host thermal tolerance in a model system: frogs infected with the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. Infection reduced the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) of hosts by up to ~4 °C. Acclimation to realistic daily heat pulses enhanced thermal tolerance among infected individuals, but the magnitude of the parasitism effect usually exceeded the magnitude of the acclimation effect. In ectotherms, behaviors that elevate body temperature may decrease parasite performance or increase immune function, thereby reducing infection risk or the intensity of existing infections. However, increased heat sensitivity from infections may discourage these protective behaviors, even at temperatures below critical maxima, tipping the balance in favor of the parasite. We conclude that infectious disease could lead to increased uncertainty in estimates of species' vulnerability to climate change. © 2017 The Author(s).

T2  - Journal of Experimental Biology
AB  - Animals may overcome the challenges of temperature instability through behavioural and physiological mechanisms in response to short-and long-term temperature changes. When ectotherms face the challenge of large diel temperature fluctuations, one strategy may be to reduce the thermal sensitivity of key traits in order to maintain performance across the range of temperatures experienced. Additional stressors may limit the ability of animals to respond to these thermally challenging environments through changes to energy partitioning or interactive effects. Ornate burrowing frog (Platyplectrum ornatum) tadpoles develop in shallow ephemeral pools that experience high diel thermal variability (20°C) and can be exposed to high levels of UV-B radiation. Here, we investigated how development in fluctuating versus stable temperature conditions in the presence of high or low UV-B radiation influences thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity of performance traits of P. ornatum tadpoles. Tadpoles developed in either stable (24°C) or fluctuating temperatures (18-32°C) under high or low UV-B conditions. Tadpoles were tested for upper critical thermal limits, thermal dependence of resting metabolic rate and maximum burst swimming performance. We hypothesised that developmental responses to thermal fluctuations would increase thermal tolerance and reduce thermal dependence of physiological traits, and that trade-offs in the allocation of metabolic resources towards repairing UV-B-induced damage may limit the ability to maintain performance over the full range of temperatures experienced. We found that P. ornatum tadpoles were thermally insensitive for both burst swimming performance, across the range of temperatures tested, and resting metabolic rate at high temperatures independent of developmental conditions. Maintenance of performance led to a trade-off for growth under fluctuating temperatures and UV-B exposure. Temperature treatment and UV-B exposure had an interactive effect on upper critical thermal limits possibly due to the upregulation of the cellular stress response. Thermal independence of key traits may allow P. ornatum tadpoles to maintain performance in the thermal variability inherent in their environment. © 2014. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Temperate-zone amphibians generally show an acclimation response of tolerance to high temperatures (CTMax). The Puerto Rican frog Eleutherodactylus portoricensis failed to show an acclimation response, but did show a negative correlation between elevation and CTMax. Subsequently, E. portoricensis, as originally understood, was found to consist of a widespread species (Eleutherodactylus coqui) and a species restricted to high elevations (E. portoricensis). CTMax was determined for these 2 species. Differences previously believed to be attributable to elevation are, in fact, interspecific differences. There were no differences in CTMax of E. coqui from different elevations, but E. portoricensis had significantly lower CTMax. E. coqui failed to show an acclimation response. The few species of tropical amphibians that have been investigated suggest that, unlike most temperate-zone species, some tropical species fail to show an acclimation response, and some fail to show a negative correlation between CTMax and elevation. -from Authors

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity may buffer the selection pressures on organisms that inhabit novel or rapidly-changing environments. We investigated plasticity of thermal tolerance, energetic and water loss traits and their interaction with behaviour in a small-bodied, arboreal anuran (Hyperolius marmoratus Rapp, Hyperoliidae) undergoing rapid range expansion into the winter rainfall region of South Africa. After short-term exposure to three temperatures (acclimation treatments) commonly encountered in their historical and novel ranges, frogs exhibited a broad thermal tolerance range (mean±s.d.: 42.1±2.9°C) and higher plasticity in CTmax than in CTmin. Resting metabolic rate was lowest in cold-acclimated animals, while active metabolic rates were lowest in warm-acclimated frogs, likely reflecting compensation towards energy conservation. Evaporative water loss was not significantly altered by the acclimation treatments in either resting or active animals, indicating limited plasticity in this trait compared to metabolism. Our results suggest that plasticity of temperature limits and metabolism may benefit this species in variable environments such as those encountered in its expanded range. Lack of plasticity in water loss during resting and activity suggests that these frogs rely on their high cutaneous resistance and behavioural means to buffer climate variation. This study highlights the importance of synergistic interactions between physiology and behaviour in determining amphibian responses to temperature variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AU  - Sherman, E.

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - 1. We studied heat hardening in tadpoles and juveniles of the temperate Bufo americanus and the subtropical Xenopus laevis by comparing the critical thermal maxima (CTMax) of heat-pretreated animals with the CTMax of control (non-pretreated) animals of the same developmental stages. 2. While premetamorphic tadpoles (Gosner stages 26-43) of both species exhibited heat hardening, metamorphosing B. americanus tadpoles (stages 44-45) were unable to heat harden and, in fact, exhibited a decrease in CTMax following pretreatment while metamorphosing X. laevis tadpoles still exhibited heat hardening. 3. This difference may reflect the more stressful nature of the more extensive metamorphosis of Bufo compared to that of Xenopus. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Intraspecific geographic variation in thermal limits and acclimatory capacity in a wide distributed endemic frog
AU  - Barria, A.M.
AU  - Bacigalupe, L.D.
T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - Intraspecific variation in physiological traits and the standard metabolic rate (SMR) is common in widely distributed ectotherms since populations at contrasting latitudes experiences different thermal conditions. The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) states that populations at higher latitudes presents higher acclimation capacity than those at lower latitudes, given the wider range of climatic variability they experience. The endemic four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul is widely distributed in Chile. We examined the variation in maximum and minimum critical temperatures (CTmax and CTmin), preferred temperature (TPref), SMR and their acclimatory capacity in two populations from the northern and center of its distribution. All the traits are higher in the warmer population. The capacity for acclimation varies between traits and, with the exception of CTmax and TPref, it is similar between populations. This pattern could be explained by the higher daily thermal variability in desert environments, that increases plasticity to the levels found in the high latitude population. However, we found low acclimatory capacity in all physiological traits, of only about 3% for CTmin, 10% for CTmax and TPref, and 1% for SMR. Thus, despite the fact that Pleurodema thaul possess some ability to adjust thermal tolerances in response to changing thermal conditions, this acclimatory capacity seems to be unable to prevent substantial buffering when body temperatures rise. The low acclimatory capacity found for P. thaul suggests that this species use behavioral rather than physiological adjustments to compensate for environmental variation, by exploiting available micro-environments with more stable thermal conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Canadian Journal of Zoology
AB  - Anuran survival is strongly affected by exposure to high environmental temperatures. However, their upper thermal tolerances vary between species and within developmental stages. The aims of this research were to measure the median lethal temperature (LT50) of three anuran developmental stages (Gosner stages 10, 20, and 25) at a constant thermal regime, and of developing embryos (stage 10) until they became tadpoles (stage 25) exposed to daily peaks of temperatures between 1000 and 1600. Four Colombian species (Emerald-eyed Treefrog, Hypsiboas crepitans (Wied-Neuwied, 1824); Tungara Frog, Engystomops pustulosus (Cope, 1864); Rivero’s Toad, Rhinella humboldti (Gallardo, 1965); Emerald Glassfrog, Espadarana prosoblepon (Boettger, 1892)) were used in these experiments. An ontogenetic increase was observed in the upper thermal tolerance from embryos to tadpoles for all species studied. In addition, developing embryos exposed to peak temperatures showed a LT50 fairly close to the mean of the maximum habitat temperatures, particularly in H. crepitans and E. pustulosus that lay egg masses exposed directly to the sun. Environmental temperatures in the microhabitat of species studied showed values remarkably higher than their experimental LT50. Therefore, we postulate that rapid increases in environmental temperatures, as result of global or local changes, might be a critical factor for anuran survival, mainly during the embryonic stages when they are more sensitive to temperature. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.All rights reserved.

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - We studied the thermal tolerances of Rhinella arenarum during the dry and wet seasons of the Monte Desert in San Juan Province, Argentina. This toad had differences in CT max between dry and wet seasons, and the CT max values were higher in the wet season (Austral summer). Operative temperature, body temperature, environmental maximal temperature, and relative humidity were related to CT max, suggesting seasonal acclimatization of R. arenarum. Additionally, the CT max recorded for R. arenarum was 36.2°C, and the maximum ambient temperature recorded during the toads' activity time was 37°C. Also, the CT min recorded for R. arenarum was 5.3°C and the minimum environmental temperature recorded was 7.2°C. The wide thermal tolerance range recorded and the relationship between tolerance limits and the environmental extremes indicate that seasonal acclimatization is an effective mechanism by which toads can raise their thermal tolerance, allowing them to survive in the challenging conditions of the Monte Desert. Additional studies are needed to understand the relationship between the thermal tolerance of this desert amphibian and the environmental parameters that influence its thermal physiology. © 2012.

T2  - Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology -- Part A: Physiology
AB  - 1. 1. Metabolic rates, temperature acclimation, lipid deposition and temperature tolerance were investigated in two species of hylid treefrogs, the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea) and the coastal plain (Cope's) gray treefrog (Hyla chrysoscelis). 2. 2. The rate of oxygen consumption at rest differed between the two species only at 30°C; there was no difference in respiratory metabolism at lower ambient temperatures. 3. 3. Hyla cinerea generally completed metabolic acclimation earlier than H. chrysoscelis, particularly at high temperatures; both species appeared to be fully acclimated in 6 days or less. 4. 4. The gray treefrog is less tolerant of high ambient temperatures than the green treefrog; mean upper lethal temperature was 41.5°C for Hyla chrysoscelis and 43.7°C for H. cinerea. 5. 5. Metabolized energy was higher at high ambient temperatures (i.e. 29°C) for H. chrysoscelis than H. cinerea, while the reverse was true at 19°C. 6. 6. The coefficient of utilization (100 x metabolized energy/gross energy intake) did not vary significantly between species or within species over the ambient temperature range of 19-24°C; H. chrysoscelis had a significantly higher efficiency at 29°C. 7. 7. Lipid reserves were generally similar in the two species throughout the summer. 8. 8. Differences in behavior, seasonal variation in activity and timing of reproduction are all related to thermal physiology and may play a role in determining the distributional limits of the two species. © 1986.

AB  - Aim: We analysed elevational and microclimatic drivers of thermal tolerance diversity in a tropical mountain frog clade to test three macrophysiological predictions: less spatial variation in upper than lower thermal limits (Bretts’ heat-invariant hypothesis); narrower thermal tolerance ranges in habitats with less variation in temperature (Janzen's climatic variability hypothesis); and higher level of heat impacts at lower elevations. Location: Forest and open habitats through a 4,230-m elevational gradient across the tropical Andes of Ecuador. Method: We examined variability in critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) and thermal breadth (TB; CTmax–CTmin) in 21 species of Pristimantis frogs. Additionally, we monitored maximum and minimum temperatures at the local scale (tmax, tmin) and estimated vulnerability to acute thermal stress from heat (CTmax–tmax) and cold (tmin–CTmin), by partitioning thermal diversity into elevational and microclimatic variation. Results: Our results were consistent with Brett's hypothesis: elevation promotes more variation in CTmin and tmin than in CTmax and tmax. Frogs inhabiting thermally variable open habitats have higher CTmax and tmax and greater TBs than species restricted to forest habitats, which show less climatic overlap across the elevational gradient (Janzen's hypothesis). Vulnerability to heat stress was higher in open than forest habitats and did not vary with elevation. Main conclusions: We suggest a mechanistic explanation of thermal tolerance diversity in elevational gradients by including microclimatic thermal variation. We propose that the unfeasibility to buffer minimum temperatures locally may explain the rapid increase in cold tolerance (lower CTmin) with elevation. In contrast, the relative invariability in heat tolerance (CTmax) with elevation may revolve around the organisms’ habitat selection of open- and canopy-buffered habitats. Secondly, on the basis of microclimatic estimates, lowland and upland species may be equally vulnerable to temperature increase, which is contrary to the pattern inferred from regional interpolated climate estimators. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Adaptations of the reed frog Hyperolius viridiflavus (Amphibia, Anura, Hyperoliidae) to its arid environment - IV. Ecological significance of water economy with comments on thermoregulation and energy allocation
AU  - Geise, W.

T2  - Oecologia
AB  - After breeding African savanna dwelling reed-frogs of the "superspecies" Hyperolius viridiflavus face a severe dry season. The frogs withstand the adverse abiotic conditions in exposed positions, clinging to dry vegetation. Only juveniles (300-700 mg) are able to adjust water economy and metabolism to a prolonged dry season. Wet season frogs attain low levels of evaporative water loss (EWL) within 6-8 days after incipient water shortage. This time course is mainly determined by the animal's ability to lower metabolism and activity level to the minimum demands of a dry season. Barriers against diffusion of water which most probably are built up by the stratum corneum and/or the overlying film of dried mucus seem not to be essentially modified during adjustment to dry season conditions. Changeover to dry season physiology is greatly accelerated through preconditioning frogs to water shortage. Adult Hyperoliusare unable to reduce activity and metabolism as fast and effectively as juveniles. Most probably these are the main reasons for their very restricted survival capability under dry season conditions; the generally poor energy reserves after the breeding period may further shorten their survival time. At the critical thermal maximum (CTM) Hyperolius uses skin gland secretions for evaporative cooling. Acclimation effects and regulation of evaporative cooling within some 1/10° C help to employ limited water reserves very economically. Dry adapted, dehydrated frogs take up water, whenever available, via specialized skin areas. Rate of uptake is high and is mainly determined by the actual stage of dehydration. The onset of the water-balance-response is also affected by preconditioning. Survival time of small (<500 mg) estivating Hyperolius is limited by their water reserves.Due to their unfavourable surface to volume ratio they loserelatively more water by evaporation than larger conspecifics. Therefore, smaller specimens should allocate energy preferably to growth, until reducing EWL so far to survive the average periods between the rare precipitations. In larger frogs (>500 mg) the amount of stored energy determines maximal survival time. When a critical size is reached in postmetamorphic growth, a change in energy allocation from body growth to energy storage would improve prospects of survival and should therefore be expected. Species specific differences in regard to EWL and CTM indicate a strong correlation between physiological properties and ecological demands. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - 1. 1. The induction and decay kinetics of rapid increases in thermal tolerance (heat hardening) in Eurycea bislineata following exposure to either Critical Thermal Maximum (CTM) or 1 h at 2° below CTM were similar. Thermal tolerance increased to a maximum within 1 1 2h post-heat treatment of either type, and returned to near the original level within 24 h. However, the one hour heat treatment resulted in a larger amount of heat hardening (0.9 vs 0.6°C at optimum development). 2. 2. Most Desmognathus ochrophaeus did not heat harden in response to either CTM or a one hour sub-CTM exposure. 3. 3. CTM was significantly higher in D. ochrophaeus (33.9°C) than in E. bislineata (33.2°C), whereas certain sub-CTM changes in behavior/coordination were lower in D. ochrophaeus. The importance of these sub-CTM changes is discussed. © 1987.

AB  - Abstract1.Hydrated and dehydrated juvenile western toads (Bufo boreas) were exposed for 24 hr to sublethal concentrations of the organophosphorus insecticides Abate®, fenthion, chlorpyrifos-methyl, chlorpyrifos-ethyl, methylparathion, and the insect growth regulator, Altosid®.2.The most pronounced reduction in temperature tolerance occurred with the exposure to the insecticide fenthion; exposure to Altosid® caused the least reduction in temperature tolerance.3.In most cases the temperature tolerances of the dehydrated toads were not lowered significantly, and in some cases, were higher than toads exposed in the hydrated condition to the same chemical and concentration suggesting that dehydrated toads were metabolizing the chemicals at a greater rate than hydrated animals.4.The thermal tolerance was lowered significantly by all chemicals tested against concentrations at least one-half the usual field concentrations.5.Control toads were more active than any of the treated individuals suggesting that other physiological responses were also affected. © 1976.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is an anuran toad species distributed latitudinal and altitudinal (1200-5000. m) from Peru to Argentina, inhabiting mountain valleys in the Andes. Considering the broad range of habitats where they live, it is important to understand the thermal physiological mechanisms, thermal tolerances and physiological adaptations for surviving in rigorous environments. We investigated the thermal parameters (field body temperature, selected body temperature, locomotor performance in field and laboratory conditions, and thermal extremes) during diurnal activity for a population of juvenile, post-metamorphosed toads (Rhinella spinulosa) from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina. Post-metamorphic toads are active from approximately 1100-1900 (in contrast to nocturnal adult toads). Our findings show that these toads have a wide thermal tolerance range, ranging from a critical thermal maximum of 36.9. °C to crystallization temperatures below 0. °C. During their active period, toads always showed suboptimal thermal conditions for locomotion. Despite the suboptimal condition for the locomotion, diurnal activity is likely to confer thermal advantages, allowing them to search for food and increase digestion and growth rates. We also found that the toads are capable of super-cooling, which prevents mortality from freezing when the environmental temperatures drop below 0. °C. The environmental temperatures are below zero at night, when toads are inactive and take refuge under rocks. In summary, this toad population demonstrates high thermal plasticity, as shown by a relatively high level of activity sustained over a wide range of ambient temperature (~35 °C). These thermal adaptations allow this species of juvenile toads to inhabit a wide range of altitudes and latitudes. © 2015.

AB  - Complex life-histories may promote the evolution of different strategies to allow optimal matching to the environmental conditions that organisms can encounter in contrasting environments. For ectothermic animals, we need to disentangle the role of stage-specific thermal tolerances and developmental acclimation to predict the effects of climate change on spatial distributions. However, the interplay between these mechanisms has been poorly explored. Here we study whether developmental larval acclimation to rearing temperatures affects the thermal tolerance of subsequent terrestrial stages (metamorphs and juveniles) in common frogs (Rana temporaria). Our results show that larval acclimation to warm temperatures enhances larval heat tolerance, but not thermal tolerance in later metamorphic and juvenile stages, which does not support the developmental acclimation hypothesis. Further, metamorphic and juvenile individuals exhibit a decline in thermal tolerance, which would confer higher sensitivity to extreme temperatures. Because thermal tolerance is not enhanced by larval developmental acclimation, these ‘risky’ stages may be forced to compensate through behavioural thermoregulation and short-term acclimation to face eventual heat peaks in the coming decades. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - For ectothermic species with broad geographical distributions, latitudinal/altitudinal variation in environmental temperatures (averages and extremes) is expected to shape the evolution of physiological tolerances and the acclimation capacity (i.e., degree of phenotypic plasticity) of natural populations. This can create geographical gradients of selection in which environments with greater thermal variability (e.g., seasonality) tend to favor individuals that maximize performance across a broader range of temperatures compared to more stable environments. Although thermal acclimation capacity plays a fundamental role in this context, it is unknown whether natural selection targets this trait in natural populations. Additionally, understanding whether and how selection acts on thermal physiological plasticity is also highly relevant to climate change and biological conservation. Here, we addressed such an important gap in our knowledge in the northernmost population of the four-eyed frog, Pleurodema thaul. We measured plastic responses of critical thermal limits for activity, behavioral thermal preference, and thermal sensitivity of metabolism to acclimation at 10 and 20°C. We monitored survival during three separate recapture efforts and used mark-recapture integrated into an information-theoretic approach to evaluate the relationship between survivals as a function of the plasticity of thermal traits. Overall, we found no evidence that thermal acclimation in this population is being targeted by directional selection, although there might be signals of selection on individual traits. According to the most supported models, survival increased in individuals with higher tolerance to cold when cold-acclimated, probably because daily low extremes are frequent during the cooler periods of the year. Furthermore, survival increased with body size. However, in both cases, the directional selection estimates were nonsignificant, and the constraints of our experimental design prevented us from evaluating more complex models (i.e., nonlinear selection). © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - As ectotherms, amphibians may exhibit changes in their thermal biology associated with spatial and temporal environmental contingencies. However, our knowledge on how amphibian´s thermal biology responds to seasonal changes in the environment is restricted to a few species, mostly from temperate regions, in a marked contrast with the high species diversity found in the Neotropics. We investigated whether or not the seasonal variation in climatic parameters from a high-montane ombrophilous forest in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest could lead to concurrent adjustments in the thermal biology of the terrestrial toad Rhinella icterica. We measured active body temperature (Tb) in the field, and preferred body temperature (Tpref) and thermal tolerance (critical thermal minimum, CTmin, and maximum, CTmax) in the laboratory, for toads collected at two distinct seasons: warm/wet and cold/dry. We also measured operative environmental temperatures (Te) using agar toad models coupled with dataloggers distributed in different microhabitats in the field to estimate accuracy (db) and effectiveness (E) of thermoregulation of the toads for both seasons. Toads had higher Tpref in the warm/wet season compared to the cold/dry season, even though no seasonal change occurred in field Tb's. In the warm/wet season, toads decreased the accuracy of thermoregulation and avoided thermally favorable microhabitats, while in the cold/dry season they increased the accuracy of thermoregulation and exhibited high degree of thermoconformity. This result may encompass thermoregulatory adjustments to seasonal changes in Te's, but may also reflect seasonal differences in compromises between Tb regulation and other ecologically relevant activities (reproduction, foraging). Toads did not exhibit changes in CTmin or CTmax, which indicates a low risk of exposure to extreme temperatures in this particular habitat, at both seasons, possibly combined with a low flexibility of this trait. Overall, our study shows seasonal acclimatization in some aspects of the thermal biology of the toad, R. icterica. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A species’ thermal sensitivity and its exposure to climate variation are key components in the prediction of its vulnerability to climate change. We tested the thermal sensitivity of a tropical amphibian that lives in a mild constant climate in which the thermal tolerance range is expected to closely match the experienced environmental temperature. The air temperature that this species is exposed to varies between 21.9 and 31.6°C with an annual mean of 27.2°C. We estimated the microhabitat water temperature variation under vegetation shade, which buffers the temperature by 1.8°C in relation to that of the air, and with open canopy, where the water was 1.9°C warmer than the air temperature. With broods of tadpoles split into five treatments (15°C, 21°C, 28°C, 31°C, and 33°C), we estimated the critical thermal maximum (CTMax) and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) after at least 7 days of acclimation. Both CTMax (42.3°C) and CTMin (11.8°C) were more extreme than the temperature range estimated for the field. We estimated the optimum temperature (To = 28.8°C) and the thermal performance breadth (range: 23.3–34.1°C) based on growth rate (g/day). The animals were able to acclimate more extensively to cold than to warm temperatures. These performance curve traits closely matched the air temperature. The estimated vulnerability varied according to the microhabitat prediction model used. The combination of tadpole data on thermal sensitivity and macro- and microhabitat variation provides a necessary framework to understand the effects of climate change on tropical amphibians. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation

AB  - We study the variation in thermal parameters in two contrasting populations Yungas Redbelly Toads (Melanophryniscus rubriventris) with different discrete color phenotypes comparing field body temperatures, critical thermal maximum and heating rates. We found significant differences in field body temperatures of the different morphs. Temperatures were higher in toads with a high extent of dorsal melanization. No variation was registered in operative temperatures between the study locations at the moment of capture and processing. Critical thermal maximum of toads was positively related with the extent of dorsal melanization. Furthermore, we founded significant differences in heating rates between morphs, where individuals with a high extent of dorsal melanization showed greater heating rates than toads with lower dorsal melanization. The color pattern-thermal parameter relationship observed may influence the activity patterns and body size of individuals. Body temperature is a modulator of physiological and behavioral functions in amphibians, influencing daily and seasonal activity, locomotor performance, digestion rate and growth rate. It is possible that some growth constraints may arise due to the relationship of color pattern-metabolism allowing different morphs to attain similar sizes at different locations instead of body-size clines. © 2014.

AB  - Body temperatures, critical thermal maxima, tolerance to water loss, and rehydration rates were measured for T. diurnus in the rain forest on Mt. Glorious, south-eastern Queensland. Body temperatures ranged from 13·6 to 22·8°C (mean 18·4 ±1·9°C) for adults and from 14·0 to 23·8°C (mean 19·8 ± 2·4°C) for juveniles. Body temperatures were significantly higher in juveniles. The critical thermal maximum for T. diurnus was 31 1 ± 1·2°C and ranged from 28·4 to 33·7°C. Minimal activity temperatures appear to be reached in winter months. The mean lethal water loss for T. diurnus was 26·2 ± 4·3% of the original weight; this species shows less tolerance to desiccation than other Australian anurans that have been studied. © 1971, CSIRO.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is one of the anuran species with the greatest presence in Chile. This species mainly inhabits mountain habitats and is distributed latitudinally along the western slope of the Andes Range. These habitats undergo great temperature fluctuations, exerting pressure on the amphibian. To identify the physiological strategies and thermal behavior of this species, we analyzed the temperature variables CTmin, CTmax, TTR, τheat, and τcool in individuals of three sites from a latitudinal gradient (22°S to 37°S). The amphibians were acclimated to 10 °C and 20 °C and fed ad libitum. The results indicate that the species has a high thermal tolerance range, with a mean of 38.14±1.34 °C, a critical thermal maxima of 34.6–41.4 °C, and a critical thermal minima of 2.6–0.8 °C, classifying the species as eurythermic. Furthermore, there were significant differences in CTmáx and TTR only in the northern site. The differences in thermal time constants between sites are due to the effects of size and body mass. For example, those from the central site had larger size and greater thermal inertia; therefore, they warmed and cooled in a slower manner. The wide thermal limits determined in R. spinulosa confirm that it is a thermo-generalist species, a characteristic that allows the species to survive in adverse microclimatic conditions. The level of plasticity in critical temperatures seems ecologically relevant and supports the acclimatization of thermal limits as an important factor for ectothermic animals to adapt to climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

T2  - Journal of Thermal Biology
AB  - We determined if the photoperiod regime affects the thermal biology of the tadpoles of Odontophrynus occidentalis from the Monte desert (Argentina). Variables measured were: selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and thermal critical minimum (CTmin). The tadpoles were acclimated to 15±2°C for 15 days, and they were divided in three experimental groups: 24h light, 24h dark and 12h/12h light/dark. Data indicate that the photoperiod had an important effect upon the thermal biology of the Odontophrynus occidentalis tadpoles. The treatment group exposed to 24h of light showed the highest selected temperature and thermal extremes. We suggest that changes in photoperiod may allow these organisms to anticipate the future changes in their thermal environment, as longer days usually involve higher temperatures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Climate change is affecting biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide, and the lowland tropics are of special concern because organisms living in this region experience temperatures that are close to their upper thermal limits. However, it remains unclear how and whether tropical lowland species will be able to cope with the predicted pace of climate warming. Additionally, there is growing interest in examining how quickly thermal physiological traits have evolved across taxa, and whether thermal physiological traits are evolutionarily conserved or labile. We measured critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and minimum (CTmin) in 56 species of lowland Amazonian frogs to determine the extent of phylogenetic conservatism in tolerance to heat and cold, and to predict species’ vulnerability to climate change. The species we studied live in sympatry and represent ~65% of the known alpha diversity at our study site. Given that critical thermal limits may have evolved differently in response to different temperature constraints, we tested whether CTmax and CTmin exhibit different rates of evolutionary change. Measuring both critical thermal traits allowed us to estimate species’ thermal breadth and infer their potential to respond to abrupt changes in temperature (warming and cooling). Additionally, we assessed the contribution of life history traits and found that both critical thermal traits were correlated with species’ body size and microhabitat use. Specifically, small direct-developing frogs in the Strabomantidae family appear to be at highest risk of thermal stress while tree frogs (Hylidae) and narrow mouthed frogs (Microhylidae) tolerate higher temperatures. While CTmax and CTmin had considerable variation within and among families, both critical thermal traits exhibited similar rates of evolutionary change. Our results suggest that 4% of lowland rainforest frogs assessed will experience temperatures exceeding their CTmax, 25% might be moderately affected and 70% are unlikely to experience pronounced heat stress under a hypothetical 3C temperature increase. © 2019 von May et al.

T2  - Herpetological Journal
AB  - Physiological tolerance to variable environmental conditions is essential for species to disperse over habitat boundaries and sustain populations in new habitats. In particular, salinity and temperature are one of the major factors determining species’ distributions. The tree frog Buergeria japonica is the most widely distributed amphibian species found in the Ryukyu Archipelago in Japan and Taiwan, and uses a wide range of breeding sites. Such characteristics suggest a high salinity and thermal tolerance in B. japonica tadpoles. We measured the salinity and thermal tolerance of tadpoles from three islands to determine if physiological tolerance could have contributed to the wide dispersal and survival across different environments. The critical salinity of B. japonica was 10–11‰, a value markedly below seawater. We also observed a critical maximum temperature of approximately 40°C, a value which is higher than what is commonly observed for other anuran species. This high thermal tolerance may have favoured island dispersal and survival, particularly in volcanic islands. © 2017, British Herpetological Society. All rights reserved.

The thermal tolerance was significantly lowered by all chemicals and concentrations tested. Chlorpyrifos and methyl parathion were the most active compounds tested whereas malathion was the least toxic to H regilla tadpoles. Activity was depressed, in comparison to control tadpoles, by the chemicals methyl parathion (100 ppb) and malathion (500 ppb). Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved

AB  - Temperature and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are key environmental drivers that are linked in their effects on cellular damage. Exposure to both high temperatures and UVR can cause cellular damage that result in the up-regulation of common protective mechanisms, such as the induction of heat shock proteins (Hsps) and antioxidants. As such, the interactive effects of these stressors at the cellular level may determine physiological limits, such as thermal tolerance. Furthermore, antioxidant activity is often thermally sensitive, which may lead to temperature dependent effects of UVR exposure. Here we examined the interactive effects of temperature and UVR on upper thermal limits, Hsp70 abundance, oxidative damage and antioxidant (catalase) activity. We exposed Limnodynastes peronii tadpoles to one of three temperature treatments (constant 18. °C, constant 28. °C and daily fluctuations between 18 and 28. °C) in the presence or absence of UVR. Tadpoles were tested for upper thermal limits (CTmax), induction of Hsp70, oxidative damage and catalase activity. Our results show that CTmax was influenced by an interactive effect between temperature and UVR treatment. For tadpoles kept in cold temperatures, exposure to UVR led to cross-tolerance to high temperatures, increasing CTmax. Plasticity in this trait was not fully explained by changes in the lower level mechanistic traits examined. These results highlight the difficulty in predicting the mechanistic basis for the interactive effects of multiple stressors on whole animal traits. Multifactorial studies may therefore be required to understand how complex mechanistic processes shape physiological tolerances, and determine responses to environmental variation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To examine whether different thermal environments have induced a change in thermal characteristics, we have conducted a between-population comparison on broad geographic patterns of preferred body temperature and critical thermal maximum in a giant spiny-frog Paa spinosa. We found a bimodal pattern of preferred body temperature during the day, with high preferred body temperature during the inactive diurnal period and low temperature during the active nocturnal period. There were significant differences among six populations of P. spinosa in preferred body temperatures, which decreased along a south to north gradient. Unlike preferred body temperatures, critical thermal maximum did not differ between frogs from the six localities. Although not all characteristics of thermal physiology in P. spinosa underwent parallel changes between the populations, the shift of preferred body temperatures suggests that the features of thermal physiology in the frog may change along a latitudinal gradient in response to different thermal environments. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The current global warming scenario has led to a renewed interest in determining which species are more vulnerable to climate change. Hence, it is important to understand which factors can affect estimates of species vulnerability. We determined the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) for six species of North American anuran larvae and measured the environmental temperatures to which they are exposed during their aquatic stage to estimate their warming tolerance (WT; difference between the critical thermal maximum and the macro- and microhabitat maximum environmental temperatures). Our results indicate that these species exhibited CTmax values (37.8–41.7 °C) that were similar to other temperate species and positively correlated only with environmental temperatures measured at the microclimate scale. This indicates that microclimatic variables are better predictors of CTmax variation than macroclimate data. Moreover, most of the CTmax variation found was associated with higher taxonomic levels, indicating that related species may show similar CTmax values due to phylogenetic inertia. Studied species also exhibited high values of WT (10.3–22.6 °C), similar to temperate amphibian species from other bioregions. This indicates that there is a considerable gap between the species’ critical thermal maximum and maximum environmental temperature, whether using datalogger (microclimate) or WorldClim (macroclimate) environmental data. However, WT estimates based on datalogger data were not related to those based on macroclimate environmental data. Finally, variation associated with the type of environmental data used (macro- vs. microclimate) had a profound influence on WT estimates. Hence, our perception of which species are more vulnerable to global warming changes may depend on the scale of the climate data used. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Ectotherms are vulnerable to climate change, given their dependence on temperature, and amphibians are particularly interesting because of their complex life cycle. Tadpoles may regulate their body temperature by using suitable thermal microhabitats. Thus, their physiological responses are the result of adjustment to the local thermal limits experienced in their ponds. We studied three anuran tadpole species present in Argentina and Chile: Pleurodema thaul and Pleurodema bufoninum that are seasonal and have broad geographic ranges, and Batrachyla taeniata, a geographically restricted species with overwintering tadpoles. Species with restricted distribution are more susceptible to climate change than species with broader distribution that may cope with potential climatic changes in the environments in which they occur. We aim to test whether these species can buffer the potential effects of climate warming. We used ecological niche models and the outcomes of their thermal attributes (critical thermal limits, optimal temperature, and locomotor performance breadth) as empirical evidence of their capacity. We found that Pleurodema species show broader performance curves, related to their occurrence, while the geographically restricted B. taeniata shows a narrower thermal breadth, but is faster in warmer conditions. The modeled distributions and empirical physiological results suggest no severe threats for these three anurans. However, the risk level is increasing and a retraction of their distribution range might be possible for Pleurodema species, and some local population extinctions may happen, particularly for the narrowly distributed B. taeniata. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH

AB  - The Barton Springs Salamander (Eurycea sosorum) is listed federally as endangered and is an obligate aquatic salamander with a substantial population occurring in a few spring outflows located in a highly urbanized recreational area near downtown Austin, Texas, USA. The purpose of this study was to gain essential information regarding the response of E. sosorum to several thermal manipulations. All salamanders used in this study were produced at the San Marcos Aquatic Resources Center (United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in San Marcos, Texas, USA, as part of a captive breeding program. To examine the effects of thermal stressors, we subjected salamanders to a nominal temperature increase of 0.5° C per day until we observed a loss of righting response (LRR). Additionally, we assessed salamander growth following a 69-d trial in which we reared young E. sosorum at five temperature treatments (nominal 15, 18, 21, 24 and 27° C). The cumulative ET50 (Effective Temperature at which half of the salamanders experienced a LRR [mean ± SD]) for the combined replicates observed in E. sosorum was 32.6 ± 0.08° C. The optimal temperature for growth of E. sosorum based on weight and total length was estimated to be 18.7° C and 18.3° C, respectively. These results will aid in the conservation, management, and ongoing efforts to culture E. sosorum in captivity. Further, our results may provide insight to the potential thermal tolerances of other perennibranchiate Eurycea salamanders in central Texas thought to be sensitive to thermal fluctuations in their habitats. © 2016.

TI  - Limited capacity for acclimation of thermal physiology in a salamander, Desmognathus brimleyorum

AB  - Habitats vary in temperature both spatially and temporally. Variation in thermal habitat introduces challenges to organisms and may reduce fitness unless organisms can physiologically adjust to such changes. Theory predicts that thermal variability should influence the capacity for acclimation such that increased variation should favor a reduction in the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits. In this study, we investigated acclimation to constant and variable conditions in populations of the salamander Desmognathus brimleyorum from the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, USA. We exposed salamanders to constant and variable temperature regimes for 8 weeks in the laboratory. We then tested salamanders for acclimation of thermal tolerance, and the thermal sensitivities of swimming performance and standard metabolic rate. Our results indicate limited capacity for thermal acclimation to constant and variable conditions in D. brimleyorum. Instead, variation in physiological traits is dominated by differences among populations. Population differences do not appear to be correlated with observed variation in the thermal conditions of the streams, but are likely a consequence of structural and ecological differences. Due to the mixed support for theoretical predictions for acclimation to alternative environments, further consideration should be given to revising and expanding current theoretical models. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We studied the thermal tolerances of Odontophrynus occidentalis during the dry and wet seasons of the Monte Desert in San Juan Province, Argentina. This toad had differences in CTmax between dry and wet seasons, with CTmax values being greater in the wet season (Austral summer). Operative temperature, body temperature, and environmental maximal temperature were related to CTmax suggesting seasonal acclimatization in O. occidentalis. Additionally, the CTmax recorded for O. occidentalis was 36.1 °C, and the maximum ambient temperature measured during the toads activity time was 37 °C. The CTmin of O. occidentalis was 4.1 °C while the minimum environmental temperature recorded was 7.2 °C. The wide tolerance range observed and the relationship between tolerance limits and the environmental extremes indicate that seasonal acclimatization is an effective mechanism by which toads can raise their thermal tolerance. This is a highly relevant adaptation allowing them to survive in the challenging conditions of the Monte Desert.

Plethodon jordani had substantial amounts of heat shock protein (hsp) 70 present in its tissues when acclimated to 15°C (LD 12:12). 3. The increase in hsp 70 in P. jordani (13.2%) after heat shock at 2°C below its critical thermal maximum (CTMax) (34.1 °C) was not statistically significantly higher than the control value. 4. An immunoblot with monoclonal antibody after 2-D SDS PAGE gel indicated that constitutive hsp 70 was the major form of hsp 70 in P. jordani.

AB  - Predicting the effects of high environmental temperatures and drought on populations requires understanding how these conditions will influence the thermoregulatory behavior and thermal tolerance of organisms. Ectotherms show proportional (fine-tuned) and all-or-none (abrupt) responses to avoid overheating. Scattered evidence suggests that dehydration alters these behavioral responses and thermal tolerance, but these effects have not been evaluated in an integrative manner. We examined the effects of hydration level on the behavioral thermoregulation and behavioral and physiological thermal limits of the “bullfrog” (Rana catesbeiana), a well-studied and important invasive species. To examine the effects of dehydration on proportional responses, we compared the Preferred Body Temperatures (PBT) of frogs with restricted and unrestricted access to water. To assess the effect of dehydration on all-or-none responses, we measured and compared the Voluntary Thermal Maximum (VTMax) at different hydration levels (100%, 90%, 80% of body weight at complete hydration). Finally, to understand the effect of dehydration on physiological thermal tolerance, we measured the Critical Thermal Maximum (CTMax) of frogs at matched hydration levels. PBT, VTMax, and CTMax all decreased in response to higher dehydration levels. However, bullfrogs changed their PBT more than their VTMax or CTMax in response to dehydration. Moreover, some severely dehydrated individuals did not exhibit a VTMax response. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of plasticity of thermoregulatory responses and thermal limits, and its potential application to mechanistic modeling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Environmental variation induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten species by causing environmental stress. Anuran larvae experiencing environmental stress may display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits. Therefore, any capacity to adapt to environmental changes through plastic responses provides a key to determining species vulnerability to environmental variation. We investigated whether developmental temperature (Tdev), altered TH levels and whether the interactive effect of both affect standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), survival and thermal tolerance in larvae of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) reared at five temperatures with experimentally altered TH levels. At metamorphosis, SMR, BC and survival were significantly affected by Tdev, TH status and their interaction with the latter often intensified impacts. Larvae developing at warmer temperatures exhibited significantly higher SMRs and BC was reduced at warm Tdev and high TH levels suggesting decreased ability to acclimate to variation in temperature. Accordingly, tadpoles that developed at warm temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but more narrow thermal tolerance windows. High and low TH levels decreased and increased upper thermal limits, respectively. Thus, when experiencing both warmer temperatures and environmental stress, larvae may be less able to compensate for changes in Tdev. Our results demonstrate that physiological traits in larvae of X. laevis are strongly affected by increased TH levels and warmer temperatures. Altered TH levels and increasing Tdev due to global change may result in a reduced capacity for physiological plasticity. This has far reaching consequences since the energetic requirement at the onset of metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages. © The Author(s) 2018.

AU  - Reichenbach, N.

T2  - Herpetological Bulletin
AB  - The Peaks of Otter salamander, Plethodon hubrichti, is a montane species found at elevations above 442 m within a 117 km2 area of the Blue Ridge Mountains in central Virginia, USA. In areas of this species' range where the Eastern Red-backed salamander Plethodon cinereus, a potential competitor, is absent, surface-active salamander density was hypothesised to decrease at lower elevations due to increased temperatures and lower humidities, which may adversely affect salamander reproductive output and survival rates. Eggs/female, % gravid females, surface-active salamander density, temperature and relative humidity were recorded from nine sites ranging in elevation from 488 to 1143 m. Survival rates and growth rates were estimated at three of these sites. Surface-active salamander densities, survival rates, growth rates, eggs/female and reproductive output decreased with elevation. Decreases were correlated with increases in temperature and a decrease in relative humidity associated with decline in elevation. Other habitat factors such as % canopy closure did not decrease with elevation at the study sites. Peaks of Otter salamanders had greater dehydration rates and lower critical thermal maxima than the wider-ranging Eastern red-backed salamanders, which reflects their adaptation to montane environments. These results support the importance of conserving mature hardwood forests, particularly at lower elevations, which represent marginal environments for montane species of salamanders. © 2017 The British Herpetological Society.

AB  - We collected six clutches of the Cricket Frog Fejervarya limnocharis and 10 clutches of the Ornate Narrow- mouthed Frog Microhyla ornata in late June 2010 from Fuyang, Zhejiang, East China, and incubated eggs of the two species at a constant temperature of 25 °C. We raised 30 tadpoles from each clutch and released the remaining ones to the site where the clutches were collected. We randomly selected 90 tadpoles from those raised in the laboratory, and acclimated them at three constant temperatures (20, 25 and 30 °C), 30 individuals at each temperature, for two weeks to examine the influence of thermal acclimation on selected body temperature (Tsel, a measure of thermal preference) and thermal tolerance [critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax)] and viable temperature range (VTR), and whether tadpoles of these two sympatric species differ in thermal preference and thermal tolerance. Tsel was measured by recording the water temperature where the tadpole stayed in a thermal gradient ranging from 15 °Cto 38 °C. We cooled (for CTMin determination) at the rate of 0. 2 °C/ min or heated (for CTMax determination) tadpoles from 25 °Cat the rate of 0. 6 °C/ min. Body temperatures associated with a transient loss of the righting response at the lower and the upper limits of the thermal tolerance were considered to be the endpoints for CTMin and CTMax, respectively. Tadpoles of the two species did not differ in Tsel, and neither in F. limnocharis nor in M. ornata were body temperatures selected by tadpoles affected by thermal acclimatio. CTMim was greater in tadpoles of M. ornata, whereas CTMax and VTR were greater in tadpoles of F. limnocharis. CTMin and CTMax increased as acclimation temperature increased, and VTR decreased as acclimation temperature increased, in both species. Our data show that tadpoles of the two species do not differ in thermal preference but in thermal tolerance, and that thermal acclimation plays an important role in influencing thermal tolerance but not in thermal preference. Temperature is among the most important abiotic factors influencing biological processes in organisms and has consequences on their habitat requirements and hence spatial distribution, and is therefore a part of an organism's multidimensional niche that should be treated as an ecological resource. Theoretically, species cannot coexist without a quantitative partitioning of resources along the axes of diet, space, time and thermal requirement. That sympatric species respond differently to variation in temperature at the spatial scale of the local community by using microhabitats with different thermal regimes may facilitate their coexistence. Our finding that tadpoles of F. limnocharis and M. ornata differ in thermal tolerance may have an implication for their differences in microhabitat use in nature, which may promote the coexistence of these two sympatric frog species.

AB  - Global warming is having impacts across the Tree of Life. Understanding species’ physiological sensitivity to temperature change and how they relate to local temperature variation in their habitats is crucial to determining vulnerability to global warming. We ask how species’ vulnerability varies across habitats and elevations, and how climatically buffered microhabitats can contribute to reduce their vulnerability. We measured thermal sensitivity (critical thermal maximum—CTmax) of 14 species of Pristimantis frogs inhabiting young and old secondary, and primary forests in the Colombian Andes. Exposure to temperature stress was measured by recording temperature in the understorey and across five microhabitats. We determined frogs’ current vulnerability across habitats, elevations and microhabitats accounting for phylogeny and then ask how vulnerability varies under four warming scenarios: +1.5, +2, +3 and +5°C. We found that CTmax was constant across species regardless of habitat and elevation. However, species in young secondary forests are expected to become more vulnerable because of increased exposure to higher temperatures. Microhabitat variation could enable species to persist within their thermal temperature range as long as regional temperatures do not surpass +2°C. The effectiveness of microhabitat buffering decreases with a 2–3°C increase, and is almost null under a 5°C temperature increase. Microhabitats will provide thermal protection to Andean frog communities from climate change by enabling tracking of suitable climates through short distance movement. Conservation strategies, such as managing landscapes by preserving primary forests and allowing regrowth and reconnection of secondary forest would offer thermally buffered microhabitats and aid in the survival of this group. © 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Environmental stress induced by natural and anthropogenic processes including climate change may threaten the productivity of species and persistence of populations. Ectotherms can potentially cope with stressful conditions such as extremes in temperature by exhibiting physiological plasticity. Amphibian larvae experiencing stressful environments display altered thyroid hormone (TH) status with potential implications for physiological traits and acclimation capacity. We investigated how developmental temperature (Tdev) and altered TH levels (simulating proximate effects of environmental stress) influence the standard metabolic rate (SMR), body condition (BC), and thermal tolerance in metamorphic and post-metamorphic anuran larvae of the common frog (Rana temporaria) reared at five constant temperatures (14–28 °C). At metamorphosis, larvae that developed at higher temperatures had higher maximum thermal limits but narrower ranges in thermal tolerance. Mean CTmax was 37.63 °C ± 0.14 (low TH), 36.49 °C ± 0.31 (control), and 36.43 °C ± 0.68 (high TH) in larvae acclimated to different temperatures. Larvae were able to acclimate to higher Tdev by adjusting their thermal tolerance, but not their SMR, and this effect was not impaired by altered TH levels. BC was reduced by 80% (metamorphic) and by 85% (post-metamorphic) at highest Tdev. The effect of stressful larval conditions (i.e., different developmental temperatures and, to some extent, altered TH levels) on SMR and particularly on BC at the onset of metamorphosis was carried over to froglets at the end of metamorphic climax. This has far reaching consequences, since body condition at metamorphosis is known to determine metamorphic success and, thus, is indirectly linked to individual fitness in later life stages. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Biological and methodological factors influence the upper thermal limits (UTL) of ectothermic animals, but most factors have been studied independently. Few studies have integrated variables, so our understanding about sources of UTL variation remains fragmentary. Thereby, we investigated synergic effects of experimental protocols (heating rates, ΔTs) and biological factors (ontogeny and body mass) on the UTL on the larvae of two anuran species (Physalaemus nattereri and Boana pardalis), specifically their Critical Thermal Maximum (CT max ). The species displayed slightly different responses to ΔTs: In B. pardalis tadpoles both average and variance of CT max increased at a fastest ΔT, the same response happened in P. nattereri tadpoles at slow and moderate ΔTs. Also, the CT max of P. nattereri declined at the end of metamorphosis independently of ΔT, but tadpoles at all developmental stages still displayed higher heat tolerance at the slow ΔT. Finally, we detected small, synergic effects of body mass and ΔTs on the CT max of both species. In small B. pardalis tadpoles and premetamorphic P. nattereri tadpoles, body mass had a positive effect on CT max , but only at slow and moderate ΔTs, probably indicating physiological responses. A similar trend was observed in large B. pardalis tadpoles at the fast ΔT, but this result is likely to be influenced by thermal inertia. Our findings contribute to integrate the understanding of factors influencing UTL in small ectothermic animals. This understanding is critical to discuss the physiological component of vulnerability to climate change that is related to acute temperatures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Amphibians are considered one of the groups most susceptible to chemical contamination, therefore are good bio-indicators of aquatic pollution. Synergistic effects of temperature and pesticides have been found in amphibians determining amplified toxicity effect on survival and malformations with increasing temperatures. We studied the sensitivity of sublethal concentrations of chlorpyrifos in Rhinella arenarum tadpoles over on two fitness related thermal traits: locomotor swimming performance and thermal tolerance limits (CTmax = critical thermal maximum and CTmin = critical thermal minimum). Our result shows a decrease in the locomotor performance of R. arenarum tadpoles with increasing sublethal chlorpyrifos concentrations. The experimental temperature increased locomotor performance but this being only significant for the control whereas tadpoles raised at any sublethal chlorpyrifos concentration did not increase their total swimming distance with temperature (Concentration × Temperature interaction, P &lt; 0.019). Chlorpyrifos toxicity decreases maximum swimming distance but this reduction not compensated at high temperatures that do enhance swimming performance in the control treatment. On the other hand, higher chlorpyrifos sensitivity in CTmax than CTmin since tadpoles exposed to all polluted treatments exhibits a significant decline in CTmax but not in CTmin. Current global warming and the increase of atypical climatic events, such as heat waves may put at risk the larval chlorpyrifos polluted populations of R. arenarum. Our results show that the sublethal concentrations of the chlorpyrifos pesticide may affect the fitness and survival of the larvae of R. arenarum. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Global climate change will have a greater impact on ectotherms in tropical and subtropical communities than at higher latitudes, because ambient temperatures are closer to the upper thermal limits of species. Amphibian species are highly dependent on external weather conditions, and the effect of global warming on these has been evaluated recently. The Great Chilean frog (Calyptocephalella gayi) is an endemic, monotypic species and genus whose conservation status is considered Vulnerable because of high extraction pressure for human consumption, lack of regulatory measures and comprehension by its consumers. Their populations have also declined due to the loss and destruction of their habitats. C. gayi has not been considered as an object of physiological study, so this large species is not known as one that can adapt to current environmental changes. In this study we analyze the thermoregulatory capacity and thermal efficiency of C. gayi to determine its potential for climatic adaptation. The results indicate that this species is strictly a thermal-conformer; its thermal efficiency and its ability to withstand high temperatures allow it to sustain itself under a climate change scenario, however, it has thermal constraints that do not allow it to withstand temperatures greater than 30 °C. By modeling its ontogenetic conditions mathematically, we project that the larvae are not in danger, although there is a group of around 4% which is very close to 30 °C, which is the highest temperature recorded for the species. However, about 40% of subadults and approximately 47% of adult frogs will not survive the change of ~7 °C projected for the following 85 years, which will affect future generations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We studied a combination of thermal parameters (critical thermal maximum, selected body temperature, and field body temperature) and locomotor performance capacities (laboratory and field conditions) of juveniles of Pleurodema nebulosum. We found that field body temperature was determined largely by the temperature of the micro-environment. Field body temperatures of juveniles of P. nebulosum were below selected body temperature. The locomotor performance curve was maximized and reaches a plateau between 30 and 35°C, with 35°C being the temperature at which maximum performance was obtained for analyzed individuals. The plateau values were close to the selected body temperature (Tsel) obtained for the studied frogs. In field conditions the locomotor performance was determinated by the substrate temperature. Apparently, juveniles of P. nebulosum show thermal coadaptation because the selected body temperature and the optimum temperature for locomotion had close values. We believe that the temperatures prevailing during the early hours of activity would allow frogs to explore the micro-environment, covering larger areas in search of food. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Body temperature is the most important physiological variable affecting the performance of ectothermic animals. In June and October of 2011, we collected female and male subadults (gonads have not yet matured), juveniles (tails have just been completely absorbed), and tadpoles (stages 28-38) of the tiger frog Hoplobatrachus chinensis, which is a national secondary grade protection animal, from the herpetological laboratory of Lishui University, Zhejiang, East China. The objectives of this study were to examine ontogenetic shifts in the selected body temperature (Tsel), critical thermal maximum (CTmax), and critical thermal minimum (CTmin) of the tiger frog. Tsel of tadpoles was measured by recording the water temperature of their selected location in a thermal gradient ranging from 10-42°C, while Tsel of juveniles and subadults was measured by recording cloacal temperature in a thermal gradient ranging from 20-45°C. We cooled (for CTmin determination) or heated (for CTmax determination) experimental animals from 25°C. Body temperatures associated with a transient loss of the righting response at lower and upper limits of thermal tolerance were considered to be the endpoints for CTmin and CTmax, respectively. Statistical analysis by ANOVA showed that there were significant differences in Tsel, CTmin, CTmax, and viable temperature range among the three age groups. The Tsel of juveniles (24. 10°C) was significantly lower than that of female subadults (28. 06°C), male subadults (29. 17°C), and tadpoles (28. 23°C), while there was no significant difference in Tsel among the latter three groups. The CTmin of juveniles (13. 85°C) was significantly higher than that of female subadults (11. 27°C), male subadults (10. 84 °C), and tadpoles (10. 74 °C), while there was no significant difference in CTmin among the latter three. Tadpoles had the highest CTmax, which was 43. 31°C, followed by subadults (female: 39. 55°C; male: 39. 02°C) and juveniles in decreasing order. Similarly, tadpoles had the widest viable temperature range (32. 58 °C), followed by subadults (female: 28. 28 °C; male: 28. 18 °C), and juveniles (21. 62°C) in decreasing order. There were no significant differences in Tsel, CTmin, CTmax, and viable temperature range between female and male subadults. Body temperature of juveniles and subadults of H. chinensis was significantly correlated with water temperature in both decreasing and increasing rates. After removing the effects of water temperature, changes in rates of body temperature variation were removed by using residuals from the regression. Two-way ANOVA (cooling and heating rate were measured repeatedly) indicated that the rates of change in the body temperature of juveniles were significantly greater than rates of change of subadults. Types of thermal changes (i. e. rates of cooling and heating) and the interaction of these factors had no effect on changes in the body temperature of H. chinensis. In conclusion, we suggest that in the tiger frog H. chinensis, fundamental thermal niche separation and development restrictions are the most probable explanations for our findings.

AB  - The conversion of natural habitats to human land uses often increases local temperatures, creating novel thermal environments for species. The variable responses of ectotherms to habitat conversion, where some species decline while others persist, can partly be explained by variation among species in their thermal niches. However, few studies have examined thermal niche variation within species and across forest-land use ecotones, information that could provide clues about the capacity of species to adapt to changing temperatures. Here, we quantify individual-level variation in thermal traits of the tropical poison frog, Oophaga pumilio, in thermally contrasting habitats. Specifically, we examined local environmental temperatures, field body temperatures (Tb), preferred body temperatures (Tpref), critical thermal maxima (CTmax), and thermal safety margins (TSM) of individuals from warm, converted habitats and cool forests. We found that frogs from converted habitats exhibited greater mean Tb and Tpref than those from forests. In contrast, CTmax and TSM did not differ significantly between habitats. However, CTmax did increase moderately with increasing Tb, suggesting that changes in CTmax may be driven by microscale temperature exposure within habitats rather than by mean habitat conditions. Although O. pumilio exhibited moderate divergence in Tpref, CTmax appears to be less labile between habitats, possibly due to the ability of frogs in converted habitats to maintain their Tb below air temperatures that reach or exceed CTmax. Selective pressures on thermal tolerances may increase, however, with the loss of buffering microhabitats and increased frequency of extreme temperatures expected under future habitat degradation and climate warming.

AB  - The developmental environment has significant immediate effects on phenotypes, but it may also persistently or permanently shape phenotypes across life history. This study examined how developmental temperature influenced embryonic and larval phenotypes of Baja California chorus frog (Pseudacris hypochondriaca), an abundant amphibian in southern California and northern Baja California. We collected egg clutches from native ponds in northern San Diego County within 24 h of fertilization, and clutches were separated and distributed between constant temperatures of 10, 15, 20, and 25°C for incubation. Oxygen consumption rate (V.O2), developmental stage, and embryo and yolk masses were measured throughout development. Time to 50% hatch, survival at 50% hatch, and hatch duration were determined. Development rate was strongly affected by temperature, with warmer temperatures reducing time to hatch and hatch duration. Survival to hatch was high across all temperatures, 90% Mass-specific V.O2of embryos either remained constant or increased throughout development, and by hatching energy demand was significantly increased at higher temperatures. There were limited temperature effects on growth, with embryo and yolk dry mass similar between temperatures throughout embryonic development. To examine long-Term effects of embryonic temperature, we reared hatchlings from each temperature until onset of larval feeding. Once feeding, larvae were acclimated to 20 or 25°C (2 weeks). Following acclimation to 20 or 25°C, we measured larval mass-specific V.O2 and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) at a common developmental stage (Gosner stages 32-36, "hindlimb toe differentiation"). Embryonic temperature had persistent effects on larval V.O2and CTMax, with warmer temperatures generally resulting in similar or higher V.O2 and CTMax. This partially supported a "warmer is better" effect of embryonic incubation temperature. These results suggest that in a thermally robust amphibian species, temperature may program the phenotype during early development to construct traits in thermal tolerance and energy use that may persist. Overall, P. hypochondriaca displays a thermally robust phenotype, and it is possible that amphibians that possess a wider range of phenotypic plasticity will be relatively more successful mitigating effects of climate change. © 2019 Mueller, Bucsky, Korito and Manzanares.

AB  - Rhinella spinulosa is distributed from Peru to Argentina (from 1200 to 5000 m elevation), inhabiting arid mountain valleys of the Andes, characterized by salty soils. The variations in soil salinity, caused by high evapotranspiration of water, can create an osmotic constraint and high thermal oscillations for metamorphsed Andean toad (R. spinulosa), affecting their thermoregulation and extreme thermal tolerances. We investigated the changes in thermal tolerance parameters (critical thermal maximum and crystallization temperature) of a population of metamorphosed R. spinulosa from the Monte Desert of San Juan, Argentina, under different substrate salinity conditions. Our results suggest that the locomotor performance of metamorphs of R. spinulosa is affected by increasing salinity concentrations in the environment where they develop. On the other hand, the thermal extremes of metamorphs of R. spinulosa also showed changes associated with different salinity conditions. According to other studies on different organisms, the increase of the osmolarity of the internal medium may increase the thermal tolerance of this species. More studies are needed to understand the thermo-osmolar adjustments of the metamorphs of toads to environmental variability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Thermal acclimatory adjustments of locomotor performance and thermal tolerance occur commonly in ectothermic animals. However, few studies have investigated ontogenetic differences in these acclimatory responses, and thus, their causes remain unclear. In this study, juvenile and adult Chinese fire-bellied newts (Cynops orientalis) were acclimated to one of two temperatures (16 or 24 °C) for 4 weeks to examine ontogenetic differences in acclimation effect on burst swimming speed, and critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax). Swimming performance was thermally acclimated in both juvenile and adult C. orientalis. Adult newts had greater absolute swimming speeds than juveniles, which may simply result from their larger sizes. Cold acclimation enhanced low-temperature resistance, and warm acclimation enhanced high-temperature resistance in both juveniles and adults. Despite no ontogenetic difference in CTMin, adult newts had greater CTMax and acclimation response ratio than juveniles, indicating their greater abilities to withstand extreme high temperatures and manage rapid temperature shifts. Ontogenetic change in the thermal acclimatory responses of newts may be related to changes in the thermal environment they experience. © Firenze University Press.

AB  - The Japanese stream tree frog, Buergeria japonica, is widely distributed across the southern islands of Japan and Taiwan. While the species is known to inhabit hot springs, this has only been reported in Taiwan. To further understand the utilization of hot springs by B. japonica, we conducted field observations of tadpoles from a hot spring on Kuchinoshima Island, a tiny volcanic island of southwestern Japan. We found that tadpoles on Kuchinoshima Island inhabited hot spring pools with extremely high temperatures that exceeded temperatures in which any other amphibians have been found. In addition, we conducted thermal tolerance measurements and found that the thermal tolerance of B. japonica tadpoles was high. These findings suggest that high thermal tolerance of B. japonica is maintained even at the northern tip of its distribution, and this has allowed them to widen their available niche and inhabit a hot spring on the tiny island of Kuchinoshima. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2016.

AB  - Xenopus tropicalis has many advantages as a next-generation model animal for biological research. However, the temperature tolerance range of this frog is narrow, making transportation of live specimens difficult under extreme air temperatures in the summer and winter. This seasonal constraint diminishes the usefulness of X. tropicalis as an experimental animal, so an improved transportation method is required. To overcome this challenge, we conducted: (1) survival experiments under extreme temperature conditions; (2) tests of thermal retention abilities of a unique transport container system; and (3) actual transport experiments. Survival experiments indicated that 14-31C was a safe temperature range for 48-h survival of adult X. tropicalis (48 hours corresponds to the standard domestic transport time expected for delivery service companies in Japan). The container system built here was able to maintain safe temperatures over 72 h when outside temperatures were extreme, and it worked better in combination with a plastic box frog cage. The effectiveness of the transport container was demonstrated by actual transport experiments performed during the summer and winter. The survival rates of the frogs were 100% with the container system. Because the transport container can maintain mild temperatures internally over 72 h, this container system can be used to transport many different temperature-sensitive organisms. © 2014 by The Herpetological Society of Japan.

AB  - 1. 1. Various blood constituents were measured in an attempt to identify the effects of exposure of Great Plains toads to the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and determine the time course of the onset of and recovery from these effects. 2. 2. Tests for generalized tissue damage inclucling serum glutamic-oxalacetic and glutamic-pyruvic transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were unaffected by acute thermal stress. 3. 3. Hematocrit, erythrocyte number, mean cell volume and hemoglobin concentration were also unchanged. 4. 4. Blood glucose, lactic acid and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels all increased significantly. 5. 5. Blood pH, PO2 and HCO3- also increased with acute heat stress while PCO2 decreased. 6. 6. Long-term exposure to temperatures near the CTmax may cause severe tissue damage. Acute thermal stress does not appear to cause damage other than the short-term, reversible effects of strong physical exercise. © 1987.

AB  - The vulnerability of species to climate change is jointly influenced by geographic phenotypic variation, acclimation and behavioural thermoregulation. The importance of interactions between these factors, however, remains poorly understood. We demonstrate how advances in mechanistic niche modelling can be used to integrate and assess the influence of these sources of uncertainty in forecasts of climate change impacts. We explored geographic variation in thermal tolerance (i.e. maximum and minimum thermal limits) and its potential for acclimation in juvenile European common frogs Rana temporaria along elevational gradients. Furthermore, we employed a mechanistic niche model (NicheMapR) to assess the relative contributions of phenotypic variation, acclimation and thermoregulation in determining the impacts of climate change on thermal safety margins and activity windows. Our analyses revealed that high-elevation populations had slightly wider tolerance ranges driven by increases in heat tolerance but lower potential for acclimation. Plausibly, wider thermal fluctuations at high elevations favour more tolerant but less plastic phenotypes, thus reducing the risk of encountering stressful temperatures during unpredictable extreme events. Biophysical models of thermal exposure indicated that observed phenotypic and plastic differences provide limited protection from changing climates. Indeed, the risk of reaching body temperatures beyond the species' thermal tolerance range was similar across elevations. In contrast, the ability to seek cooler retreat sites through behavioural adjustments played an essential role in buffering populations from thermal extremes predicted under climate change. Predicted climate change also altered current activity windows, but high-elevation populations were predicted to remain more temporally constrained than lowland populations. Our results demonstrate that elevational variation in thermal tolerances and acclimation capacity might be insufficient to buffer temperate amphibians from predicted climate change; instead, behavioural thermoregulation may be the only effective mechanism to avoid thermal stress under future climates. © 2020 British Ecological Society

AB  - Captive-bred organisms are widely used in ecology, evolution and conservation research, especially in scenarios where natural populations are scarce or at risk of extinction. Yet, it is still unclear whether captivity may alter thermal tolerances, crucial traits to predict species resilience to global warming. Here, we study whether captive-bred tadpoles of the gliding treefrog (Agalychnis spurrelli) show different thermal tolerances than wild-caught individuals. Our results show that there are no differences between critical thermal limits (CTmax and CTmin) of captive-bred and wild-caught tadpoles exposed to three-day acclimatization at 20 °C. Therefore, we suggest that the use of captive-bred amphibians is valid and may be appropriate in experimental comparisons to thermal physiological studies of wild populations. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Short-legged, small, robust frogs of the family Craugastoridae present a remarkable beta-diversity in the high Andes, their distributions being characterized by a very high degree of micro-endemism to specific valleys. We used dataloggers to study the temperature and humidity conditions of microhabitats of several species of the genus Microkayla at three elevation belts: Below, within, and above the altitudinal range of their distribution in Bolivia. We also conducted thermal physiology experiments on a limited number of individuals of one of these species. Our aim was to infer on factors that may limit the distribution of anurans in a biological hotspot that is threatened by climate warming. We found an unexpected thermal heterogeneity within the slopes at three different Andean valleys that explained the specific distribution of species of Microkayla at each site. Species distribution was associated to elevation belts with the highest ambient relative humidity, and there was high variability in thermal preference when individuals were experimentally exposed to a thermal gradient. Critical thermal maxima compared to the temperatures that frogs confront in nature, as well as thermal performance trials, revealed that the studied species has a broad physiological tolerance to temperature. These results point to moisture, and not temperature, as the limiting climatic factor determining the occurrence of these species in high Andean slopes, but further experimental work on water balance is needed. The predicted desertification of the Andes in future climate change scenarios poses a potentially serious threat to this highly diverse group of amphibians. © 2020 Brazilian Society of Herpetology.

AB  - Environmental temperature has fitness consequences on ectotherm development, ecology and behaviour. Amphibians are especially vulnerable because thermoregulation often trades with appropriate water balance. Although substantial research has evaluated the effect of temperature in amphibian locomotion and physiological limits, there is little information about amphibians living under extreme temperature conditions. Leptodactylus lithonaetes is a frog allegedly specialised to forage and breed on dark granitic outcrops and associated puddles, which reach environmental temperatures well above 40 ˚C. Adults can select thermally favourable microhabitats during the day while tadpoles are constrained to rock puddles and associated temperature fluctuations; we thus established microhabitat temperatures and tested whether the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of L. lithonaetes is higher in tadpoles compared to adults. In addition, we evaluated the effect of water temperature on locomotor performance of tadpoles. Contrary to our expectations, puddle temperatures were comparable and even lower than those temperatures measured in the microhabitats used by adults in the daytime. Nonetheless, the CTmax was 42.3 ˚C for tadpoles and 39.7 ˚C for adults. Regarding locomotor performance, maximum speed and maximum distance travelled by tadpoles peaked around 34 ˚C, approximately 1 ˚C below the maximum puddle temperatures registered in the puddles. In conclusion, L. lithonaetes tadpoles have a higher CTmax compared to adults, suggesting a longer exposure to extreme temperatures that lead to maintain their physiological performance at high temperatures. We suggest that these conditions are adaptations to face the strong selection forces driven by this granitic habitat. © 2019, British Herpetological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Climate change and infectious disease by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) are major drivers of amphibian extinctions, but the potential interactions of these two factors are not fully understood. Temperature is known to influence (1) the infectivity, pathogenicity and virulence of Bd; (2) host-parasite dynamics, especially when both hosts and parasites are ectothermic organisms exhibiting thermal sensitivities that may or may not differ; and (3) amphibian vulnerability to extinction depending on their heat tolerance, which may decrease with infection. Thus, in a global warming scenario, with rising temperatures and more frequent and extreme weather events, amphibians infected by Bd could be expected to be more vulnerable if temperatures approach their critical thermal maximum (CTmax). However, it is also possible that predicted high temperatures could clear the Bd infection, thus enhancing amphibian survival. We tested these hypotheses by measuring CTmax values of Bd-infected and Bd-free aquatic tadpoles and terrestrial toadlets/juveniles of the common midwife toad (Alytes obstetricans) and examining whether exposure of A. obstetricans individuals to peak temperatures reaching their CTmax clears them from Bd infection. We show that (1) Bd has a wide thermal tolerance range; (2) Bd is capable of altering the thermal physiology of A. obstetricans, which is stage-dependent, lowering CTmax in tadpoles but not in toadlets; and (3) Bd infection is not cleared after exposure of tadpoles or toadlets to CTmax. Living under climatic change with rising temperatures, the effect of Bd infection might tip the balance and lead some already threatened amphibian communities towards extinction. © 2019 Fernández-Loras et al.

AB  - Environmental temperature variation generates adaptive phenotypic differentiation in widespread populations. We used a common garden experiment to determine whether offspring with varying parental origins display adaptive phenotypic variation related to different thermal conditions experienced in parental environments. We compared burst swimming performance and critical thermal limits of African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) tadpoles bred from adults captured at high (~2000 m above sea level) and low (~ 5 m above sea level) altitudes. Maternal origin significantly affected swimming performance. Optimal swimming performance temperature (Topt) had a >9°C difference between tadpoles with low altitude maternal origins (pure- and cross-bred, 35.0°C) and high-altitude maternal origins (pure-bred, 25.5°C; cross-bred, 25.9°C). Parental origin significantly affected critical thermal (CT) limits. Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins had higher CTmax (37.8±0.8°C) than pure-bred tadpoles with high-altitude parental origins and all crossbred tadpoles (37.0±0.8 and 37.1±0.8°C). Pure-bred tadpoles with low-altitude parental origins and all cross-bred tadpoles had higher CTmin (4.2±0.7 and 4.2±0.7°C) than pure-bred tadpoles with highaltitude parental origins (2.5±0.6°C). Our study shows that the varying thermal physiological traits of Xenopus laevis tadpoles are the result of adaptive responses to their parental thermal environments. This study is one of few demonstrating potential intraspecific evolution of critical thermal limits in a vertebrate species. Multi-generation common garden experiments and genetic analyses would be required to further tease apart the relative contribution of plastic and genetic effects to the adaptive phenotypic variation observed in these tadpoles. © 2021 Company of Biologists Ltd.

AB  - Organisms with complex ecologies and life-cycle processes may shift physiologically (acclimation in tolerance), developmentally, and/or behaviorally (thermoregulation) in response to changes in climate. As such, climate change may trigger multiple, interacting phenotypic responses, which underscores the nuances of characterizing a species capacity to adapt and respond to climate change. In this study, we use a model frog species, Bufo gargarizans, to examine how three phenotypes, thermal tolerance limits (critical thermal minimum, CTmin and critical thermal maximum, CTmax), ontogeny, and behavioral preferences in temperature (Tpref) respond to different levels of thermal exposure (i.e., acclimation ranging from 10 °C to 30 °C). Acclimation temperature had little effect on Tpref of tadpoles, yet behaviorally they showed strong signs of thermal selection towards an optimum. Both CTmin and CTmax increased with acclimation temperature with an approximate 10% increase in tolerance limits per 1 °C increase in exposure. Development and body size both responded to acclimation temperature, both of which also influenced lower but not upper thermal limits. Our study highlights the idiosyncrasies of estimating climate vulnerability, where multiple phenotypes can respond to shifts in temperature—a complexity that is especially apparent in species with complex life-cycles. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Current assessments of organismal vulnerability to global warming are focusing on physiological trait-based indices that may allow biologically sounding estimates of heating risk at the local scale. However, intraspecific variability in both exposure and physiological performance may determine large heterogeneity in the distribution of heating risks through the overall species range compromising whole species risk assessments. We examine intra- and interspecific variability in two vulnerability indexes: warming tolerances (WT), or the extent that maximum temperatures (T max) reaching upper thermal tolerances (CTmax); and thermal safety margin (TSM), or the magnitude that average environmental temperatures (T mean) exceeding the selected or preferred temperatures (T sel), in a subtropical warm amphibian tadpole community, at the Monte Desert ecoregion, Argentina. Tadpole populations breeds in temporary ponds and permanent streams that exhibit high thermal heterogeneity. Those populations and species living in hot water bodies, although exhibiting higher CTmax, have lower WT and are more prone to suffer acute heat impacts, thus confirming the prediction of higher thermal risk in ectotherms exposed to higher temperatures. However, these hot pond breeders, although living closer to their CTmax, also preferred high temperatures, showing higher TSMs and being actually exposed to a lower proportion of stressful temperatures than cool selecting populations. Both WT and TSM indexes have significant interpopulational variation. Thus, our findings suggest that attempts to build mechanistic models to forecast species vulnerability to heat stress due to climate change have to include physiological variation among populations. © 2020 The Zoological Society of London

AB  - Communities usually possess a multitude of interconnected trophic interactions within food webs. Their regulation generally depends on a balance between bottom-up and top-down effects. However, if sensitivity to temperature varies among species, rising temperatures may change trophic interactions via direct and indirect effects. We examined the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 19 species from temperate wetlands (insect predators, amphibian larvae, zooplankton and amphipods) and determined if they vary in their sensitivity to warming temperatures. CTmax differed between the groups, with predatory insects having higher CTmax than amphibians (both herbivorous larval anurans and predatory larval salamanders), amphipods and zooplankton. In a scenario of global warming, these differences in thermal tolerance may affect top-down and bottom-up processes, particularly considering that insect predators are more likely to maintain or improve their performance at higher temperatures, which could lead to increased predation rates on the herbivores in the food web. Further studies are needed to understand how the energy flows through communities, how species’ energy budgets may change and whether other physiological and behavioral responses (such as phenotypic plasticity and thermoregulation) can buffer or increase these changes in the top-down regulation of wetland food webs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Hybridization between native and non-native species is an ongoing global conservation threat. Hybrids that exhibit traits and tolerances that surpass parental values are of particular concern, given their potential to outperform native species. Effective management of hybrid populations requires an understanding of both physiological performance and the underlying mechanisms that drive transgressive hybrid traits. Here, we explore several aspects of the hybridization between the endangered California tiger salamander (Ambystoma californiense; CTS) and the introduced barred tiger salamander (Ambystoma mavortium; BTS). We assayed critical thermal maximum (CTMax) to compare the ability of CTS, BTS and F1 hybrids to tolerate acute thermal stress, and found that hybrids exhibit a wide range of CTMax values, with 33% (4/12) able to tolerate temperatures greater than either parent. We then quantified the genomic response, measured at the RNA transcript level, of each salamander, to explore the mechanisms underlying thermal tolerance strategies. We found that CTS and BTS have strikingly different values and tissue-specific patterns of overall gene expression, with hybrids expressing intermediate values. F1 hybrids display abundant and variable degrees of allele-specific expression (ASE), likely arising from extensive compensatory evolution in gene regulatory mechanisms between CTS and BTS. We found evidence that the proportion of genes with allelic imbalance in individual hybrids correlates with their CTMax, suggesting a link between ASE and expanded thermal tolerance that may contribute to the success of hybrid salamanders in California. Future climate change may further complicate management of CTS if hybrid salamanders are better equipped to deal with rising temperatures. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - Tropical ectotherm species tend to have narrower physiological limits than species from temperate areas. As a consequence, tropical species are considered highly vulnerable to climate change since minor temperature increases can push them beyond their physiological thermal tolerance. Differences in physiological tolerances can also be seen at finer evolutionary scales, such as among populations of ectotherm species along elevation gradients, highlighting the physiological sensitivity of such organisms. Here, we analyze the influence of elevation and bioclimatic domains, defined by temperature and precipitation, on thermal sensitivities of a terrestrial direct-developing frog (Craugastor loki) in a tropical gradient. We address the following questions: (a) Does preferred temperature vary with elevation and among bioclimatic domains? (b) Do thermal tolerance limits, that is, critical thermal maximum and critical thermal minimum vary with elevation and bioclimatic domains? and (c) Are populations from high elevations more vulnerable to climate warming? We found that along an elevation gradient body temperature decreases as environmental temperature increases. The preferred temperature tends to moderately increase with elevation within the sampled bioclimatic domains. Our results indicate that the ideal thermal landscape for this species is located at midelevations, where the thermal accuracy (db) and thermal quality of the environment (de) are suitable. The critical thermal maximum is variable across elevations and among the bioclimatic domains, decreasing as elevation increases. Conversely, the critical thermal minimum is not as variable as the critical thermal maximum. Populations from the lowlands may be more vulnerable to future increases in temperature. We highlight that the critical thermal maximum is related to high temperatures exhibited across the elevation gradient and within each bioclimatic domain; therefore, it is a response to high environmental temperatures. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Temperature plays a key role in the biology of ectotherms, including anurans, which are found at higher elevations in the tropics than anywhere in the temperate zone. High elevation tropical environments are characterized by extreme daily thermal fluctuation including high daily maxima and nightly freezing. Our study investigated the contrasting operative temperatures of the anurans Telmatobius marmoratus and Pleurodema marmoratum in different environmental contexts at the same elevation and biome above 5,200 m. Telmatobius marmoratus avoids extremes of daily temperature fluctuation by utilizing thermally buffered aquatic habitat at all life stages, with minimal operative temperature variation (range: 4.6–8.0°C). Pleurodema marmoratum, in contrast, experienced operative temperatures from −3.5 to 44°C and has one of the widest thermal breadths reported for any tropical frog, from >32°C (critical thermal maximum) to surviving freezing periods of 1 and 6 hr down to −3.0°C. Our findings expand experimental evidence of frost tolerance in amphibians to the widespread Neotropical family Leptodactylidae, the first such evidence of frost tolerance in a tropical amphibian. Our study identifies three strategies (wide thermal tolerance breadth, use of buffered microhabitats, and behavioral thermoregulation), which allow these tropical frogs to withstand the current wide daily thermal fluctuation above 5,000 m.a.s.l. and which may help them adapt to future climatic changes.

AB  - Most of the literature on temperature–organism interactions rely on mean temperature (mostly air), disregarding the real complexity of this variable. There is a growing consensus about the importance of considering the temperature fluctuations as a mechanism improving organism's performance. Tadpoles are small body size ectotherm organisms that behave isothermally with their environment. As such, are good models for studying their thermal biology relative to their immediate environment. We studied six anuran tadpole species in North Patagonia, Alsodes gargola, Hylorina sylvatica, Batrachyla taeniata, Pleurodema thaul, P. bufoninum and Rhinella spinulosa, distributed in a West-East altitudinal cline with different environments and thermal conditions. We evaluated the relationship between thermal descriptors at a local scale and the thermal biology patterns of these temperate tadpoles. We estimated thermal tolerance limits and thermal sensitivity of locomotion of each species. The different aquatic environments showed important differences in local thermal conditions, associated with observed differences in the thermal traits in these tadpoles. Species exposed to lower temperature fluctuations and lower environmental mean temperatures showed lower swimming optimal temperatures and narrower thermal tolerance ranges. We found greater variability in the upper than in the lower critical limits in these Patagonian anuran tadpoles. Minimum critical temperatures were close to freezing temperature, possibly in detriment of their tolerance to high temperatures. Overall, our results suggest that these species are adapted to low temperatures. Finally, warming tolerances and predicted thermal safety margins, show that none of the studied species appear to be under thermal stress that may compromise their survival at the present time or in the near future, under a moderate climate change scenario. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - An organism's thermal limits provide valuable insights into species distributions and potential climate change impacts. The critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in particular has been widely used for among-species analyses of thermal tolerances. However, CTmax measurements can depend on important context-dependencies, including acclimation temperature and experimental procedure. We investigated acclimation effects on CTmax in two amphibian species commonly used as laboratory models, Ambystoma mexicanum (Axolotls) and Xenopus laevis (African Clawed Frogs), using the standard dynamic method. Both species exhibited an increased CTmax following acclimation to a warm temperature (24°C) relative to cold acclimation (8°C). We also found that warm-temperature acclimation resulted in significant mass losses in both species, possibly reflecting metabolic costs of living at higher temperatures. Our CTmax measurements for A. mexicanum were consistent with CTmax measurements for closely related salamander species, but CTmax measurements for cold-acclimated X. laevis were inconsistent with a prior study of this species. This might have been because of the earlier study employing a less common curve-fitting method to estimate CTmax. These results highlight the importance of accounting for recent acclimation temperatures when estimating amphibian thermal limits and provide further support for the generalization that most amphibian species exhibit increased CTmax following warm-temperature acclimation. © 2020 Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles.

AB  - Most predictions of how populations and species of ectotherms will respond to global warming are based on estimates of the temperature at which organisms lose motor control (i.e., CTmax - the Critical Thermal Maximum). Here, we describe a non-lethal protocol and ethograms to estimate the relative tolerance of amphibians to increasing temperatures. These methods—suitable for field or laboratory conditions—are replicable, inexpensive and applicable to both post-metamorphic stages and organisms with direct development. We illustrate the use of this standardized protocol for four amphibians from a tropical cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico with contrasting life histories: a lungless salamander (Aquiloeurycea cafetalera: Plethodontidae), a leaf-litter frog (Craugastor rhodopis: Craugastoridae), a semiaquatic frog (Lithobates berlandieri: Ranidae), and a tree frog (Rheohyla miotympanum: Hylidae). We identified four behavioral responses preceding CTmax for all amphibians included in this study: 1) Optimal Activity Range, 2) Supra-optimal Activity Range, 3) Heat Stress Range, and 4) Involuntary Movements Range. Additionally, we identified a fifth parameter associated with resilience to heat shock: 5) Recovery Stage after reaching CTmax. We conclude that the behavioral responses preceding the Critical Thermal Maximum are as informative as CTmax. Using behavioral responses to estimate thermal tolerance has the additional advantage of reducing the risk of injury or death of amphibians during physiological experiments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Information on the thermal limits and physiology of ectothermic amphibians is crucial to our understanding of their ecology in the natural environment, particularly with predicted global changes in climate. We documented the thermal limits of larvae of three amphibian species native to Hong Kong, and their introduced, invasive predator, the mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). We then used larvae of the brown tree frog Polypedates megacephalus as a model amphibian to further investigate growth, oxygen consumption rate and heat shock protein expression with changes in thermal regime. We found that G. affinis was the most tolerant of low temperatures but also the least tolerant of high temperatures. Despite the higher thermal tolerance of the amphibian larvae, further investigation on P. megacephalus demonstrated that optimal temperatures for physiological performance fall within a range of 18.0–21.6 °C, which is far lower than its upper thermal limit, implying that thermal stress occurs during part of the larval stage under natural environmental conditions. This could mean a reduction in their capacity to deal with other stressors such as pollution and predators, and that G. affinis may have an advantage over native amphibians. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Cardiorespiratory studies in tadpols species are scarce, reflecting challenges of using invasive tools, for measuring heart rate (fH) and breathing frequency (fB) by means of implanting electrodes, cannulae, and others, especially in the case of long-term measurements. This study attempted to improve techniques previously used by Longhini and coworkers (2017) on measuring cardiorespiratory parameters non-invasively in bullfrog tadpoles in a much smaller anuran tadpole specie, Boana albopunctaca (Anura: Hylidae) from the Savannah-like Cerrado. This specie occurs in the central, southern and southeastern regions of Brazil in an area where deforestation levels are high. Objective: To determine the resting values for fH and fB of tadpoles (stage 26 from Gosner, 1960) B. albopunctata at 25°C using a non-invasive methodology. Additionally, we determined the Maximum Critical Temperature (CTmax) by exposing tadpoles to a heating ramp (1°C/4min). Material and Methods: Pre-metamorphic tadpoles (N=11) of Boana albopunctata were collected (SISBIO: 621361) in the Cerrado biome, in Minas Gerais state (20º 14' 43" S; 46º 21' 57" O), and maintained in the lab in aquariums at 25°C. The cardiorespiratory parameters, fH and fB, were obtained by a non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG) and surface electromyogram (EMG) method, respectively. After baseline measurement, animals were handled in order to administer an intraperitoneal injection of Ringer solution (vehicle) to verify the influence of the injections on the basal cardiorespiratory parameters, which were recorded for an additional hour. For that, we used a thin dental needle (30 gauge) connected by a polyethylene tube (PE10, Clay Adams) to a Hamilton syringe (5 μl). The CTmax, the temperature at which animals lose the ability to escape from conditions that may ultimately lead to death, was determined by exposing tadpoles acclimatized at two different temperatures (15 and 25°C) to a constant heating rate of 1°C/4min. When the animals began to present loss of equilibrium, we stimulated them with a glass rod, and considered the CTmax when tadpoles were motionless after five consecutive taps. Immediately after assessing CTmax, we transferred tadpoles to plastic cups with water at ambient temperature (25°C). We validated the CTmax for individuals that remained alive for at least 24 h after the test. The data obtained were expressed as mean ± s. e. m. Results: At 25°C, baseline values for fH and fB were 104.6 ± 20.0 and 85.94 ± 18.9, respectively. Cardiorespiratory parameters were not significantly affected by the intraperitoneal Ringer solution injection: fH (beats.min−1): 103.2 ± 15.6 and fB (movements.min−1): 85.3 ± 16.1. Animals’ acclimatized at 20°C exhibited CTmax of 35.88 ± 1.58°C compared to those acclimatized at 30°C, with a CTmax of 39.57 ± 0.49°C. Conclusion: According to our preliminary results, we confirm that the non-invasive methodology adapted for larger tadpoles (e.g Bullfrog; size: ~9 cm) can be improved for measuring cardiorespiratory parameters non-invasively in small tadpoles (size: ~4 cm).After one hour from intraperitoneal ringer injection, fH and fB returned to their baseline values. Furthermore, animals acclimated to the higher temperature (30°C) showed greater thermal tolerance during a heating rate protocol. © 2019, Editorial Ciencias Medicas. All rights reserved.

AB  - The thermal acclimatory capacity of a particular species determines its tolerance to environmental changes and affects its survival under future changing climatic conditions. Acclimation effects on physiological traits have been determined in many fish and frog species, but rarely in newts or salamanders. In the present study, we evaluated the physiological acclimatory response of newts. A total of 48 juvenile Chinese fire-belly newts (Cynops orientalis) were collected and acclimated to 15°, 20°, and 25°, which represented the low, intermediate, and high environmental temperatures experienced by C. orientalis during their active period, respectively, over the course of 4 weeks. The locomotor (swimming) performances of individuals were measured at the same three test temperatures in a glass tank (150 cm×10 cm×15 cm) filled with water to a depth of 5 cm, and the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax) were determined using a dynamic method. The thermal resistance range (TRR) was calculated as the difference between CTMax and CTMin, and acclimation response ratio (ARR) of CTMin and CTMax was obtained by dividing the tolerance change by the change in acclimation temperature. The results from repeated-measures ANOVA analyses revealed that newt swimming speeds were significantly affected by the acclimation and test temperatures. Despite no statistically significant difference, low and intermediate temperature-acclimated newts had relatively high mean swimming speeds at 15° and 20°, respectively, while the high-temperature-acclimated newts had superior swimming speeds at 25°. Similarly, at 15°, low temperature-acclimated newts swam faster than those acclimated to a high temperature. However, at 20°, intermediate temperature-acclimated newts swam faster than low or high temperature-acclimated individuals, while at 25°, high and intermediate temperature-acclimated newts swam faster than those acclimated to low temperature. Thus, our data supports the beneficial acclimation hypothesis, which predicts that acclimation to a particular temperature enhances the animal’s performance or fitness at that temperature. Our results also indicate that temperature acclimation shifts the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance in C. orientalis since low temperature-acclimated newts appear to have lower thermal sensitivity levels than those acclimated to high temperature. Both CTMin and CTMax were significantly enhanced at higher acclimation temperatures, suggesting that juvenile newts acclimated to low temperatures are more resistant to low temperatures and less resistant to high temperatures, whereas those acclimated to high temperatures are more resistant to high but less resistant to low temperatures. These results are consistent with previous studies focused on the various ectothermic vertebrate species analyzed to date. The TRR of newts was not affected by acclimation temperature, while the ARR of CTMax (0.26) was higher than that of CTMin (0.09) at acclimation temperatures between 15° and 20°, but lower at acclimation temperatures between 20° and 25° (CTMax:0.16 vs CTMin:0.21). These results are consistent with previous predictions that the magnitude of the change in CTMin or CTMax slowly decreases and ultimately approaches zero as the acclimation temperature gradually reaches its thermal limits. Inter-species differences in thermal physiological response to acclimation in amphibians may be correlated with differences in thermal environments in their natural habitats. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

AB  - Daily thermal fluctuations (DTFs) impact the capacity of ectotherms to maintain performance and energetic demands because of thermodynamic effects on physiological processes. Mechanisms that reduce the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits may buffer ectotherms from the consequences of DTFs. Species that experience varying degrees of DTFs in their environments may differ in their responses to thermally variable conditions, if thermal performance curves reflect environmental conditions. We tested the hypothesis that in response to DTFs, tadpoles from habitats characterised by small DTFs would show greater plasticity in the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes than tadpoles from environments characterised by large DTFs. We tested the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits in tadpoles of three species that differ naturally in their exposure to DTFs, raised in control (24°C) and DTF treatments (20-30°C and 18-38°C). DTFs reduced growth in all species. Development of tadpoles experiencing DTFs was increased for tadpoles from highly thermally variable habitats (∼15%), and slower in tadpoles from less thermally variable habitats (∼30%). In general, tadpoles were unable to alter the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes, although DTFs induced plasticity in metabolic enzyme activity in all species, although to a greater extent in species from less thermally variable environments. DTFs increased upper thermal limits in all species (between 0.89 and 1.6°C). Our results suggest that the impact of increased thermal variability may favour some species while others are negatively impacted. Species that cannot compensate for increased variability by buffering growth and development will probably be most affected.

TI  - Effects of Photoperiod and Starvation on the Temperature Tolerance of Larvae of the Giant Toad, Bufo marinus
AU  - Floyd, Robert B.
T2  - Copeia
AB  - The effect of photoperiod on the heat and cold tolerance of Bufo marinus larvae was greatest under conditions that were potentially lethal. Larvae that were acclimated to high temperatures and long days had a higher critical thermal maximum (CTMax) than those acclimated to short days. Similarly, larvae acclimated to lower temperatures and short days were more tolerant to cold than those acclimated to long days. Larvae responded to periods of starvation in a similar way. At high acclimation temperatures, CTMax was relatively constant while CTMin increased significantly with duration of starvation (became less tolerant), and at low acclimation temperatures, CTMin remained constant and CTMax decreased significantly with starvation. CTMax and CTMin acclimated independently such that tolerance under critical conditions was maximized. The effects of photoperiod and starvation on temperature tolerance were not simple but varied with acclimation temperature.

AB  - Abstract Negative impacts on amphibians have been reported due to contamination by agrochemicals. However, until now, no study has tested the effect of the fungicide mancozeb (MZ) on thermal tolerance and its relationship with the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs). MZ is the best-selling broad-spectrum fungicide in the world, which negatively affects non-target organisms. Here, we tested for the first time the effects of MZ on critical thermal maximum (CTmax) and its relationship to the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) in tadpoles of Physalameus henselii, a colder-adapted species in southernmost of the Neotropical region. A sublethal concentration of 2 mg/L was used. We found that the CTmax of the MZ-treated group was lower than that of the control group. In addition, there was an increase in HSP70 expression in tadpoles exposed to MZ and in tadpoles that underwent heat treatment. However, tadpoles subjected to MZ and heat treatment showed no induced HSP70 protein expression. Our results demonstrated that sublethal doses of the fungicide MZ negatively affected the thermal physiology and heat shock protein expression in tadpoles of P. henselii by inducing an increase in HSP70 concentration and by reducing the critical CTmax supported by tadpoles. It is important to understand the relationship between environmental contamination and physiological thermal limits in our current scenario of high rates of habitat conversion associated with unrestricted use of agrochemicals, as well as the challenging environmental changes induced by global warming.

T2  - Ecology
AB  - Temperature tolerances of Bufo hemiophrys and B. cognatus were examined by exposing specimens to lethal high temperatures. Bufo cognatus was able to tolerate significantly higher temperatures than B. hemiophrys. The results yielded an estimated interspecific difference in upper lethal temperature of 2.34 degree plus or minus 0.41 degree. This different was correlated with the geographic distributions of the two species; i.e., the more southern species, B. cognatus, was able to tolerate higher temperatures. This has been taken to indicate that a physiological specialization has taken place which is adaptive for the two species in the microclimates of their respective habitats.

TI  - Role of Temperature and Water in the Ecology of Lungless Salamanders
AU  - Spotila, James R.
T2  - Ecological Monographs
AB  - Water economy and thermal relations of plethodontid salamanders were studied in the laboratory and in the field. Laboratory measurements included behavioral responses in temperature and relative humidity gradients, rates of dehydration and dehydration at various relative humidities and soil—moisture levels, and determination of critical thermal maxima by rapid controlled heating to a definite endpoint. Salamanders were acclimated to a combination of three temperatures and two photoperiods: 5°C, 16 hr of light alternating with 8 hr of darkness (LD 16:8); 5°C, (LD 8:16); 15°C (LD 16:8); 15°C (LD 8:16); 25°C (LD 16:8); and 25°C (LD 8:16). Three series of experiments were conducted on 20 populations representing 14 species. Critical thermal maximum increased with an increase in acclimation temperature indicating that the salamander's heat resistance was readily altered by its previous thermal history. Salamanders selected a definite range of temperatures and did not merely avoid extremes in the thermal gradient. Thermal preferenda were relatively stable for each species and were not significantly affected by either acclimation temperature or photoperiod. Rate of dehydration was dependent upon body size, drying power of the air, and ambient temperature. Interspecific differences in dehydration rates appeared to be related in part to differences in size. Species composed of small individuals lost weight faster than species made up of large individuals. As the vapor pressure deficit increased the dehydration rate increased. Dehydration was more rapid at higher temperatures. Rehydration rate increased as the percentage of weight loss due to dehydration increased and was more rapid at higher temperatures. Salamanders absorbed water from soil when soil—moisture tension was as high as 2.8 atm at 25°C. All species absorbed water from unsaturated soil at similar rates that were dependent upon soil—moisture content. Salamanders in the humidity gradient responded positively to differences in the moisture content of the air, and all but one species were more than 70% successful in selecting the highest relative humidity available in the gradient. Interspecific differences were apparent, but were not always correlated with habitat preferences. Plethodon glutinosus did not show any specific adaptation in its thermal responses or water relations that would account for its widespread distribution in the eastern United States. Plethodon ouachitae and P. caddoensis apparently have survived in the Ouachita Mountains due to favorable microhabitats and their ability to burrow deep beneath talus—covered slopes during hot and dry summers. Surface activity of P. caddoensis is limited in the summer by hot and dry conditions in its microhabitat.

AB  - Del mismo modo que la temperatura y los efectos del cambo climatico varian con en el espacio y en el tiempo, esta tesis doctoral se centra en conocer la variacion en los limites termicos fisiologicos a diferentes escalas espacio-temporales asi como caracterizar el ambiente termico al que actualmente se encuentran expuestos las poblaciones y especies de anfibios analizadas. Ello nos permitira, en primer lugar, aportar informacion basica para tratar de predecir las consecuencias del calentamiento global, y en segundo lugar, poner a prueba algunas hipotesis macrofisiologicas recientes. Asi, los capitulos 1, 2 y 3 se centran en la variabilidad espacial de los limites de tolerancia termicos en anfibios (a lo largo de gradientes altitudinales y latitudinales). Dado que existe cierta controversia acerca del grado de variacion encontrada entre poblaciones de la misma especie y entre especies distintas, los capitulos 1 y 3 adoptan un enfoque interespecifico mientras que el capitulo 2 se ocupa de analizar la variabilidad intraspecifica encontrada para una serie de poblaciones de Rana temporaria a lo largo de un gradiente climatico altitudinal. Los capitulos 4, 5 y 6 se centran en analizar el cambio en los limites de tolerancia en el tiempo ya sea a traves de procesos de aclimatacion (capitulos 4 y 5) o el cambio en las tolerancias termicas en diferentes estadios de desarrollo (capitulo 6). En el capitulo 1: “Testing the climate variability hypothesis in thermal tolerance limits of tropical and temperate tadpoles”, analizamos la variacion latitudinal en los CTmax/CTmin de 47 sp. de anfibios, durante su etapa larvaria, comparando dos comunidades procedentes de Brasil (Bahia) y la Peninsula Iberica y el Norte de Africa. En este trabajo ponemos a prueba la hipotesis de variabilidad climatica en renacuajos, analizando ademas la relevancia de la informacion termica a escalas micro y macroclimaticas como predictores de estos parametros fundamentales de las curvas de performance de los ectotermos.     En el capitulo 2: “Can breeding phenology and plasticity prevent local adaptation in thermal tolerance?”, estudiamos la variacion altitudinal de los limites de tolerancia termica en once poblaciones de Rana temporaria, al tiempo que caracterizamos su ambiente termico teniendo en cuenta la fenologia de la especie, y discutimos acerca de los aspectos que pueden estar afectando al grado de diferenciacion en las tolerancias termicas mostrado entre las poblaciones, asi como si esta diferenciacion puede responder a procesos de adaptacion local.     En el capitulo 3: “Altitudinal variation of the critical thermal limits in 20 species of tadpoles in the tropical Andes”, realizamos una comparacion altitudinal interespecifica en los limites termicos de 20 especies de anuros andinos , durente su etapa larvaria, y una valoracion preliminar del riesgo de extincion de estas especies, basandonos en las estimas de su tolerancia al calentamiento. Del mismo modo que en el capitulo 1, comprobaremos ademas como la hipotesis de variabilidad climatica puede explicar los resultados obtenidos. La segunda parte de la tesis trata de los efectos sobre las tolerancias termicas de la variacion temporal, mediante cambios en las temperaturas de aclimatacion y el estadio de desarrollo ontogenico:     En el capitulo 4: “Acclimation of critical thermal limits in temperate and tropical tadpoles”, analizamos las supuestas diferencias en el potencial de aclimatacion de anfibios tropicales y templados, sometidos a temperaturas constantes en el laboratorio (hipotesis de Brattstrom, Brattstrom (1968)).     En el capitulo 5: “The effect of constant vs fluctuating acclimation on critical thermal limits in three temperate tadpoles”, comparamos los efectos que la aclimatacion puede tener sobre las tolerancia termica de tres especies de anfibios de la Peninsula Iberica cuando se usan a) unas temperaturas de aclimatacion constantes, o b) simulando unas condiciones similares a las que pueden ocurrir en la naturaleza, mediante el empleo de aclimataciones con temperaturas diarias fluctuantes.     En el capitulo 6: “Ontogenetic shifts in thermal tolerances in temperate anurans. Does metamorphosis impose a thermal constraint that may affect vulnerability to global warming?”, analizamos los cambios que tienen lugar a lo largo del desarrollo ontogenetico (larvas, metamorficos y juveniles) en la tolerancia termica de los individuos de seis especies de anuros procedentes de Marruecos y la Peninsula Iberica.

AB  - ABSTRACT. Anurans living along the Andes cordillera exploit several thermal environments that vary with altitude and latitude. Studies on moderate and high-elevation tropical species suggest co-adaptation between thermal ecology and thermal physiology. Our objective was to test whether this is the case for three Patagonian anuran species. We focused on larval stages and analyzed critical maximum and minimum temperatures granting survivorship. The species studied were Abodes gargola, Pleurodema bufoninum and Rhinella spinulosa papillosa. Alsodes gargola lives primarily in high-elevation lakes and montane streams, has long larval development and overwinters. In contrast, tadpoles of P. bufoninum and R. s. papillosa use marshes and lower elevation ponds, and develop in three months. Tadpoles of Abodes gargola tolerated experimental temperatures up to 32°C and those of the other two species lost the ability to move at temperatures near 38°C. Tadpoles of all species tolerated experimental exposure to 0°C for a...

AB  - Survival times of anuran tadpoles representing four species of two genera in the families Hylidae and Pelobatidae were determined at high temperatures. Heat resistance was studied by acclimating tadpoles to a constant temperature and determining the time to 50% survival after direct transfer to constant, high temperatures. Results indicate that thermal acclimation influences heat resistance, and that heat resistance correlates with the species' geographic distribution and breeding habits. Tadpoles of the tropical treefrog, Hyla septentrionalis, and desert spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus couchii, were the most heat resistant; tadpoles of the western spadefoot toad, S. hammondii, from California were the next most heat resistant, and tadpoles of the Pacific treefrog, H. regilla, were the least resistant.

AB  - Adult male chorus frogs (Pseudacris triseriata) were collected from 14 breeding congregations situated along an altitudinal gradient running from approximately 1,500 m in the piedmont of northcentral Colorado to approximately 3,000 m in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains. Critical thermal maxima (CTMs), determined following acclimation of frogs at constant temperatures of 5⚬ C and 20⚬ C, were found to decline clinally with increasing elevation of the collecting sites. Since the decline in heat resistance with increasing elevation corresponds with a similar elevational gradient in ambient temperature, it appears that interpopulation variation in CTMs reflects physiological adaptation of chorus frogs to the different temperature conditions encountered at different localities.

TI  - The vulnerability of microhylid frogs, Cophixalus spp., to climate change in the Australian Wet Tropics
AU  - Merino-Viteri, Andrés Ricardo
AB  - Climate change is a global phenomenon attributable to a change in concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as a consequence of human activities since the beginning of industrialisation. The change in climatic patterns direct and indirectly affects biodiversity by, for example, promoting geographic distribution changes (elevational or latitudinal) or affecting the biological interactions of species. These effects have been proposed to more severely affect ectotherms, especially in tropical regions. Tropical regions, due to annual climatic stability, may have promoted the evolution of species with reduced thermal tolerances.     The endemic Microhylid frogs, genus Cophixalus, of the Australian Wet Tropics Bioregion (AWT) are considered one of the most threatened groups of vertebrates of the region by climate change. This vulnerability mainly comes from a reduced geographic distribution, restricted to a one or few mountain tops in the coldest, wettest and aseasonal parts of the AWT. These nocturnal frogs are forest floor dwellers and reproduce via direct development (i.e. eggs are deposited terrestrially and development occurs within the egg with froglets hatching from the egg capsule). During day time they seek shelter from ambient environmental conditions in refuges (mainly under logs, rocks or fallen epiphytes). Correlative models of distribution of this group of frogs predict a reduction of suitable climatic area in the future, however the mechanisms behind the potential changes are poorly understood. The ecological characteristics of Cophixalus and their high regional species richness (thirteen species) make this group ideal to test hypotheses about factors that influence their geographical distribution limits and potentially will influence their response to future climates.     A more accurate assessment of the vulnerability of these Cophixalus frogs to climate change depends on the understanding of the conditions the species actually are exposed to and their sensitivity to environmental change. Exposure requires accurate microenvironmental data and an understanding of seasonal or daily behavioural activity, while sensitivity can be assessed by directly quantifying the physiological thermal tolerances of the animals.     Cophixalus frogs show a consistent daily and seasonal activity pattern showing adaptations to exploit available refuges with potentially better buffering capacity, which may be important to face warmer conditions in the future.     Based on behavioural observations, a sequence of actual exposure conditions for Cophixalus frogs was constructed. Exposure conditions were found to be behaviourally buffered from ambient air conditions (by nocturnality and microhabitat use). This magnitude of the buffering varies with season, being higher during the warmest months.     Sensitivity of Cophixalus frogs was directly measured using several techniques including a dynamic method to determine critical thermal maximum and minimum. The experimental device increased or decreased temperature at a rate of approximate 1˚C/minute, until organisms lost righting capacity. The analysis of the sensitivity of organisms to climate change must be based on empirical evidence, to improve the assessment of future climate impacts. Observed thermal tolerances and limits of the Australian Wet Tropics Cophixalus frogs was not predicted by phylogenetic history, but instead was correlated with contemporary environmental conditions associated with the geographical distribution of individual species. Cophixalus frogs have narrow thermal ranges that may be explained by their narrow geographical restriction to rainforest habitats. Historical stability of environmental conditions within this ecosystem, has been proposed as a major driver of species distribution patterns and subsequent geographic species richness in this region.     The maximum thermal tolerance (CTmax) of the eleven species of Cophixalus examined, ranged from 28.1 °C to 35.9 °C, and the minimum (CTmin) ranged from 8.6 °C to 14.3 °C. Thermal tolerance range was extremely narrow compared with other tropical anurans, even for the species with the widest tolerance, Cophixalus exiguus (25.5 °C). Mean and mode of the preferred temperature showed similar values ranging from 20 °C to 29 °C across the 13 species.     The combination of measured thermal tolerances, microenvironmental exposure and ecology of species will be fundamental for the development of more accurate assessment of vulnerability to climate change. For restricted species, the analysis of these factors may also allow the identification of parameters that may be limiting their distributions. In this study, available evidence suggests that thermal physiology parameters of individual Cophixalus frogs, such as CTmax is correlated to different distribution characteristics (e.g. maximum and mid-altitude of the species distribution).     These data also allow us to determine whether species are actually filling their fundamental thermal niche. It is suggested that some species are not filling their niche. This finding may open the possibility to explore conservation strategies that may include translocation of individuals to regions where they are not currently present but environmental conditions would not act as a limitation.     When predictions of temperature change are included in the analysis, the results may be used to guide decisions about the regions and time frames when conservation strategies are required. Climate conditions under present, and two future frames (2035 and 2065) were evaluated. Our results suggest that some species may be experiencing suppressed fitness due to environmental warming even under current environmental conditions. This decrease is related to exposure to conditions warmer than their preferred temperature. The exposure to these stressful conditions are expected to occur first in the lower elevational areas of the distribution and increase in magnitude into the future.     One of the most important findings of this research is that our data suggests that no population of any Cophixalus species occurring in the AWT will be exposed to temperatures that directly cause fatalities within the timeframes evaluated. This is important because it suggests that drastic interventions to avoid local extinctions will not be necessary by 2065. However, the potential for serious indirect, or synergistic, impacts remains.     It is possible too that physiological responses to environmental parameters other than temperature may limit distributions of Cophixalus species. Another contribution of this study was to develop an experimental apparatus capable of quantifying tolerance to desiccation in hard field conditions. We provide a description of the experimental apparatus and detailed methodology as an input for future studied focused on this environmental parameter and also include some preliminary data on desiccation rates as an appendix. Cophixalus frogs show an increase of water loss with temperature, implying an increase in vulnerability to drying in the future. Cophixalus neglectus in particular seems to be highly sensitive to desiccation. Cophixalus saxatilis presents low levels of desiccation that can be explained by larger size of the species and relative low relation between surface-area and volume of individuals. Cophixalus monticola shows low water loss rates compared to close relatives of similar size. This pattern may be related to specialisation on Limnospadix palms as a preferred microhabitat which may offer less protection against water loss than other microhabitats.     The combined information assembled in this research addresses some of the important knowledge gaps identified by national authorities, needed to improving the understanding of mechanisms behind climate change impacts. This new knowledge provides a basis for the development of more robust and accurate conservation strategies that will increase the success of adaptive management focused on the conservation of species threatened with extinction, such as the Australian endemic Cophixalus frogs.

Body temperatures ranged from 17.0 to 27.2 C (mean 21.3 t+ 2.4 C) with only 30.9 per cent of the observations exceeding ambient. The critical thermal minimum was 6.1 C (range 5.0-7.5 C) and is lower than previously reported values for B. marinus from Central America. The onset of spasms (range 37.8-39.5 C) varied significantly over a 24 hr period and appeared to show a temporal pattern in heat resistance for which the functional significance is unknown at present, but possibly has survival value for this toad during the breeding season. * * *

AB  - Climate change may have dramatic consequences for communities through both direct effects of peak temperatures upon individual species and through interspecific mismatches in thermal sensitivities of interacting organisms which mediate changes in interspecific interactions (i.e. predation). Despite this, there is a paucity of information on the patterns of spatial physiological sensitivity of interacting species (at both landscape and local scales) which could ultimately influence geographical variation in the effects of climate change on community processes. In order to assess where these impacts may occur, we first need to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity in the degree of mismatch in thermal tolerances between interacting organisms. We quantify the magnitude of interspecific mismatch in maximum (CT<sub>max</sub> ) and minimum (CT<sub>min</sub> ) thermal tolerances among a predator-prey system of dragonfly and anuran larvae in tropical montane (242-3631 m) and habitat (ponds and streams) gradients. To compare thermal mismatches between predator and prey, we coined the parameters maximum and minimum predatory tolerance margins (PTM<sub>max</sub> and PTM<sub>min</sub> ), or difference in CT<sub>max</sub> and CT<sub>min</sub> of interacting organisms sampled across elevational and habitat gradients. Our analyses revealed that: (1) predators exhibit higher heat tolerances than prey (~ 4 ºC), a trend which remained stable across habitats and elevations. In contrast, we found no differences in minimum thermal tolerances between these groups. (2) Maximum and minimum thermal tolerances of both predators and prey decreased with elevation, but only maximum thermal tolerance varied across habitats, with pond species exhibiting higher heat tolerance than stream species. (3) Pond-dwelling organisms from low elevations (0-1500 m a.s.l.) may be more susceptible to direct effects of warming than their highland counterparts because their maximum thermal tolerances are only slightly higher than their exposed maximum environmental temperatures. The greater relative thermal tolerance of dragonfly naiad predators may further increase the vulnerability of lowland tadpoles to warming due to potentially enhanced indirect effects of higher predation rates by more heat-tolerant dragonfly predators. However, further experimental work is required to establish the individual and population-level consequences of this thermal tolerance mismatch upon biotic interactions such as predator-prey.

AB  - Eggs of the Chinese Frest Frog (Rana chensinensis) collected from the wild immediately after they were laid out and were incubated at five different temperatures,10℃,15℃,20℃,25℃,and 30℃ in the condition of photoperiod 14L∶10D,and 85% moisture.The cultivation period lasted 10 days.Incubation periods at each temperature level,incubation ratio,thermal threshold of development,accumulative temperature,survival rate,preferred temperature,avoidance temperature and lethal thermal temperature of tadpole incubated were recorded after 3 days incubation.Linear regression methods and direct optimum methods were used to calculate the thermal thresholds of development and accumulative incubation temperature.The incubation ratio was significantly influenced by temperature,and the survival rate decreased with the increase of incubation temperature.The body-tail length of tadpoles was significantly influenced by the incubation temperature.The thermal thresholds of development were 0.51℃ or 0.38℃.Accumulative temperature for the incubation were 65.29℃·day or 65.52℃·day.The result of direct optimum method is better than that of linear regression method.The preferred temperature of the Chinese Forest Frog tadpoles incubated 10 days under incubation temperature were 13.2±1.6℃,15.7±1.9℃,17.3±2.1℃ and 19.5±2.3℃; avoidance temperature were 28.8±1.4℃,30.2±1.6℃,31.6±1.3℃ and 33.1±1.8℃,lethal thermal temperature were 32.9±1.7℃,33.8±1.5℃,35.2±1.2℃ and 36.7±0.9℃,respectively. The preferred temperature,avoidance temperature and lethal thermal temperature of tadpoles derived from eggs incubated for 10 days at 10℃,15℃,20℃ and 25℃ were significantly influenced by temperature.

T2  - Herpetologica Romanica
AB  - The small sized yellow-bellied toad inhabits small temporary water bodies. These puddles are used by this species in both open landscapes and closed forested habitats. The thermal characteristics of these puddles in the open and closed habitat types showed considerable difference. In laboratory conditions the toad selected a narrow and low preferred temperature range (20.5-23.3°C). The measured voluntary thermal maximum (VTMaxwater) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) was 35.9 ± 1.3°C, and 38.3 ± 0.5°C respectively. In the field, the toads using the surface water layer were thermoconformers irrespective of the actual thermal environment. The high VTMaxwater and CTMax presumably permit the use of such a thermoregulatory strategy.

TI  - Tales of an ‘Invisible’ Life Stage: Survival and Physiology Among Terrestrial Juvenile Ambystomatid Salamanders
AU  - Messerman, Arianne F.
AB  - The vital rates (e.g., survival, growth, and reproduction) of distinct life stages within a species are known to influence the growth and persistence of populations. As such, studies describing stage-specific vital rates, and the factors that shape variation in these rates across species and populations, can help to improve our understanding of population dynamics and species distributions. Moreover, the insights gained from such studies can guide the prioritization of populations for conservation efforts and inform the selection of management strategies under predicted climate and land use changes. Yet life stage-specific vital rate estimates, and characterizations of the physiological responses that influence demographic rates under variable conditions, are lacking for most species.Amphibians are experiencing drastic population declines across the globe. As amphibians exhibit complex lifecycles, wherein unique life stages rely on divergent resources and habitat types, examinations of distinct life stages may be particularly critical for enhancing amphibian conservation efforts. Specifically, juveniles are known to play a critical role in amphibian population dynamics, but are relatively understudied compared with other life stages due to their small body size and often elusive life histories. The main objective of this dissertation was to elucidate survival rates, and physiological characteristics that contribute to survival, among terrestrial juveniles of multiple complex lifecycle pond-breeding salamanders in the genus Ambystoma.I first estimated juvenile survival rates among three ambystomatid species (A. annulatum, A. maculatum and A. texanum) by conducting an 11-month capture-mark- xiii recapture study within semi-natural enclosures. I found juvenile survival rates to be constant through time and comparable among species. These similarities indicated that vital rate estimates from congeneric, ecologically similar species can serve as robust place-holder information to examine the population dynamics of the many amphibian species for which stage-specific data are lacking. Next, I reared larvae of five species (A. annulatum, A. maculatum, A. opacum, A. talpoideum, and A. texanum) from populations along an ~200 km latitudinal gradient in Missouri, USA to metamorphosis under common conditions. By performing flow-through respirometry on juveniles, I found respiratory surface area water loss (RSAWL) and standard metabolic rates (SMR) to differ between species. Though SMR showed no relationship with locality, RSAWL was weakly positively correlated with latitude. This suggested that juvenile ambystomatids exposed to warmer average conditions at more southern latitudes, and thus a higher desiccation risk, may demonstrate the locally adaptive regulation of RSAWL compared with juveniles from northern populations. Given common rearing, it is likely that differences among species and populations had a genetic basis, and were not solely the result of phenotypic plasticity. I then conducted a replicated experiment to evaluate how juvenile RSAWL, SMR, and body mass might influence individual fitness by releasing A. maculatum and A. opacum juveniles from the previous study into the semi-natural enclosures for seven months of capture-mark-recapture. Examining known survival at three time points during the study, I found juveniles with higher initial body mass and/or lower SMR to have a higher likelihood of survival, particularly under warm initial conditions. There was no effect of RSAWL on survival. Acclimation experiments with surviving salamanders revealed that thermal tolerances and SMR demonstrated plastic responses to warming. Further, a simulation of juvenile survival following high temperatures suggested that the two study species may demonstrate diverging juvenile survival rates after being thermally challenged due to distinct acclimation strategies.Collectively, the results of these studies shed light on a key vital rate for ambystomatid population dynamics in a life stage that is difficult to observe. I compiled the findings of these and other ambystomatid studies to propose management objectives and strategies to conserve A. annulatum, an endemic species of the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains. This effort demonstrated the utility of life stage-specific demographic and physiological information for guiding the conservation of biodiversity.

TI  - Habitat Suitability for Eleutherodactylus Frogs in Puerto Rico: Indexing Occupancy, Abundance and Reproduction to Climatic and Habitat Characteristics
AU  - Rivera-Burgos, Ana Cecilia
AB  - What makes a habitat “suitable” for Eleutherodactylus frogs and can we predict the consequences of climate change on this taxonomic group in Puerto Rico? These questions stem by the fact that amphibian populations in Puerto Rico are declining, a trend also observed in other amphibians elsewhere in the world, and that one of the major drivers behind the negative trends is global warming. To help answer the aforementioned questions, I characterized the relationship between environmental and habitat variables, measured at the local/site level, and occupancy and the probability of detecting a chorus (≥ 4 individuals) of Eleutherodactylus wightmanae, E. brittoni, and E. antillensis, 3 species of differing size, distribution and habitat affinities. This understanding is important because shifts in abundance and distribution at larger scales begin with responses at local scales. Additionally, I determined how the same variables influenced nesting activity of E. coqui, a common and widely distributed species. Finally, I established critical thermal maximum for all 4 species as a means to gain insights on how they might respond to environmental change. Occupancy of E. wightmanae and E. brittoni was affected positively by physical/environmental covariates (e.g., relative humidity, elevation), while E. antillensis was not. Physical/environmental covariates also had a positive influence on detecting a chorus of E. wightmanae and E. brittoni, but negative on E. antillensis. Annual variation of macrohabitat covariates (e.g., ground cover) had a positive influence on E. brittoni and E. antillensis. The passing of Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 did not have a devastating effect on local population abundance, at least the sites that were accessible for monitoring. Relative humidity and temperature exerted the strongest influence on the probability of encountering active nests of E. coqui, where sites with ≤ 24 °C and ≥ 90% relative humidity had > 50% chance of having an active nest. E. brittoni (34.43 ± 0.9 ° C) and E. wightmanae (38.72 ± 1.62 °C) had statistically similar CTMax values. In contrast, CTMax for E. coqui and E. antillensis were 10-18 ° C higher. My findings help develop criteria to index habitat quality to facilitate managed translocations or in-situ habitat enhancement. My CTMax results suggest that it might be possible to group species according to their responses to ambient conditions, but also why the species does not occur below 200 m. The positive response to physical/environmental covariates by E. wightmanae and E. brittoni as compared to E. antillensis lend support to such a possibility. Taken together, my findings provide a stronger ecological basis to postulate hypotheses that more accurately test the potential linkages between environmental conditions and physiological, and ultimately, demographic responses of Eleutherodactylus frogs. Many conservation decisions, which depend on the organism’s ability to survive and reproduce, should be informed by a sound understanding of the species’ thermal window of tolerance and demographic responses to varying climatic conditions at local levels.

TI  - Thermal Physiology in a Widespread Lungless Salamander
AU  - Novarro, Alex J
AB  - Understanding species responses to climate change has become a top priority for conservation biologists. Unfortunately, current models often treat species as a single entity, ignoring population-level variation. This approach may result in major oversights when managing widespread species, which generally exhibit physiological variation across their geographic range. The eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is the most widely distributed Plethodon species, extending farther north than any other lungless salamander. This species’ geographic distribution raises two major questions: How does P. cinereus thrive across a wide range of temperatures, and does it possess thermal adaptations that will buffer the ecological consequences of climate change? To explore these questions, I first examined the effects of elevated temperature on metabolic hormone release rates and physiological performance (i.e., ingestion rate and mass gain) across a latitudinal population gradient. I found that physiological traits and populations differ in their thermal flexibility, and that salamanders from warmer localities are more resilient to elevated temperatures. Second, I performed a study to disentangle the environmental and evolutionary drivers of thermal limits across the geographic range of P. cinereus. I found strong support for evolutionary constraints on lower thermal limits, though there was some degree of plasticity in relation to local environmental temperatures. By contrast, upper thermal limits showed little variation across the species’ geographic range and among clades, and far exceeded survival requirements. Third, I combined laboratory experiments, field observations, and population models to explore the role of behavioral thermoregulation in shaping physiological performance in P. cinereus. I found that individuals are likely to exploit moist conditions at the cost of reduced performance, and that populations living in poor thermal quality habitats have greater thermoregulatory accuracy. Overall, my work demonstrates significant variation in thermal physiology across the geographic range and among lineages of P. cinereus and shows that thermal traits differ in their responsiveness to thermal variability. Together, these results highlight the importance of considering multiple physiological metrics and sampling large geographic areas to understand species’ abundance and distributions, and to assess species’ vulnerability to climate change.

TI  - Mechanisms of population divergence along elevational gradients in the tropics
AU  - Paez Vacas, Monica Isabel
AB  - Elucidating the mechanisms that give rise to population divergence and eventually initiate speciation is a key step for understanding the evolution of biodiversity. Most theories of differentiation and speciation have traditionally focused on geographically isolated populations. However, there is growing evidence that speciation can occur due to divergent selection despite initially high gene flow. My doctoral dissertation project investigates the effects of environmental heterogeneity and geography in promoting phenotypic and genetic divergence along elevation gradients in natural populations of a poison frog,  Epipedobates anthonyi, across the landscape with a focus on environmental variation along elevational gradients. I studied populations distributed along a broad elevational gradient (0–1800 m above sea level) on the western slope of the Andes of southern Ecuador. First, I examined the relative roles of geographic distance and environmental gradients on genetic and phenotypic divergence. I found that populations are phenotypically divergent in size, color, and male advertisement calls, but they exhibit low genetic divergence at neutral loci. There is substantial gene flow between populations throughout the lowlands, but populations at higher elevations are relatively isolated. This is mainly due to a mountain ridge acting as a physical and possibly environmental barrier between northern and southern populations. Within elevational gradients, geographic distance corrected for topography is the main factor explaining both genetic and phenotypic divergence. However, when controlling for the effect of topographic distance, environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation between sites best explain observed patterns of genetic divergence, whereas environmental conditions at a given site best explains differences in phenotypic traits, presumably due to divergent selection pressures.    To study the effect of temperature variation along elevational transects on adaptive divergence, I measured thermal tolerance of tadpoles across elevation. I found that populations from higher elevation had higher cold tolerance, suggesting that changes in temperature along elevation may cause divergent selection in thermal tolerance. Additionally, tadpoles from all sites have the ability to shift their thermal tolerance in response to previous exposure to different temperatures.   Finally, to examine the degree of local adaptation to environmental conditions at high and low elevations, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. I evaluated populations from high and low elevations from two elevational transects. Overall, I found that all populations have higher reproduction rates at low elevation. In fact, at high elevation, populations had very low reproductive rates or did not reproduce at all. However, variation in life-history traits differed between transects. Populations from one transect revealed a pattern that was consistent with the expectation under local adaptation, namely, low elevation frogs had higher reproduction than high elevation frogs at the low elevation site. In contrast, populations from the other transect had a pattern that would be expected under countergradient variation, namely higher elevation frogs had higher reproduction at the low elevation site. Intriguingly, low elevation frogs had overall higher reproduction rates than high elevation frogs, suggesting that frogs from low elevation have higher fecundity than their counterparts at high elevation.   Overall, the findings of my dissertation suggest that (i) phenotypic divergence occurs in the face of gene flow, (ii) environmental variation along elevation, particularly temperature, is a force that drives population divergence, and (iii) the influences of environmental conditions on populations are variable at the intraspecific level.

TI  - The thermal ecology of the Red-spotted toad, Bufo punctatus, across life history
AU  - Rausch, CM
AB  - Compared with other terrestrial vertebrates, amphibians are generally less tolerant of thermal extremes. The Mojave Desert has ambient temperatures outside the proposed thermal tolerance zone of its mort abundant amphibian, the Red-spotted toad (Bufo (Anaxyrus) punctatus). Few data have been presented regarding the thermal ecology of these animals, including their thermal histories and proposed strategies to avoid temperature extremes. Previous studies suggest B. punctatus avoids extreme thermal exposure and adult toads experience body temperature (Tb) below a proposed critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of 35°C, and can maintain Tb at 25°C during the winter. Further, previous studies indicate a CTmax for tadpoles of 33°C. A reassessment of the thermal ecology of Red-spotted toads was warranted based on personal observations reported in this thesis.    I recorded environmental and/or Tb of Red-spotted toads across their entire life history: eggs, tadpoles, juveniles and adults. In the field, eggs and tadpoles may encounter water temperatures as high as ~40°C. Juveniles can experience Tb as high as 42.2°C. Adult toads experience Tb as high as 39.1°C. These observations were combined with experimental determination of CTmax across life history statges: the CTmax of tadpoles was variable, but decreased as development progressed; adult toads exhibit a CTmax as high as 45.2 ± 1.0°C. I documented thermal preferences (Tp) of tadpoles and adults. In contrast to other studies of the effect of ontogeny on preferred temperature, Tp, of Red-spotted toads remains fairly constant across development. I documented developmental time from egg deposition to metamorphosis at 18 days in the summer and 47 days in the spring—both periods are less than the previously described 60-day developmental period. Finally, I present preliminary data on apparent basking-like behavior of late stage tadpoles in the field.    Despite seemingly high and presumably stressful environmental temperatures, Red-spotted toads do not generally live on the verge of thermal tolerance. However, later stage tadpoles may encounter potentially lethal temperatures. The collected data document the thermal ecology of Red-spotted toads and contradict previously assumed limits that may not have been experimentally-derived. These data may allow informed decision making in land use and conservation efforts by better defining an important ecological parameter in a species that may be subjected to increased pressures by human activity and climatic change.

TI  - Variation in hsp70 levels and thermotolerance among terrestrial salamanders of the Plethodon glutinosus complex
AU  - Elwood, Jennifer R. Lorenz
AB  - The Plethodon glutinosus complex is a geographically widespread salamander group inhabiting forests throughout the eastern United States and is locally abundant throughout the coastal plain. As such it is exposed to a variety of climatic conditions and makes the perfect candidate group for examining large-scale variation in thermal tolerance limits and heat shock protein expression.    Thirteen populations of the P. glutinosus complex representing three physiographic regions were examined for variation in thermotolerant capabilities along environmental gradients. Measures of thermotolerance included the preferred temperature (PT), critical thermal maximum (CTM), and levels of heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) as detected by ELISA.    Within the P. glutinosus complex there was an unexpected inverse relationship between the stress response and climate. While salamanders exhibited a significant amount of geographic variation in PT and CTM, there was a significant negative relationship between CTM and both geographic location and climate—salamanders from warm, southern climates had lower CTMs then salamanders from northern, cool climates. Hsp70 levels varied significantly among populations and physiographic regions but not among heat shocked or control treatment groups. In addition, piedmont populations contained significantly higher levels of hsp70 than either coastal plain or montane populations.    Patterns observed in the stress response of the P. glutinosus  complex reflect a “constitutive” based heat shock strategy. This strategy acknowledges that hsp70 induction incurs a fitness cost and that organisms from both relatively stable and highly disturbed habitats should trade-off inducible thermotolerance for high levels of constitutive protein. This strategy predicts that organisms from habitats with intermediate levels of disturbance would have the highest levels of inducible protein. However, because this confers a potentially high energetic cost, selection should ultimately push the population towards one side of the model or the other. Salamanders occupy relatively stable habitats on a global scale of disturbance, but even within these types of habitats trade-offs are evident. Piedmont salamanders which occupy the intermediately disturbed habitats had hsp70 levels that exceeded levels observed in both montane and coastal plain populations. Coastal plain populations behaviorally avoid stressful conditions and hence have stress responses similar to the lower stress montane populations.

TI  - The Comparative Ecologies of Two Species of Amphibia (B. bufo and B. calamita) on the Ainsdale Sand Dunes National Nature Reserve
AU  - Mathias, John Henry
AB  - The object of this study was to discover the behavioural, physiological and morphological differences between two closely related species of Amphibia: B. bufo and B. calamta in a limited habitat: the dune slacks on the Ainsdale Nature Reserve, and thus to suggest how they are able to survive together in an apparently stable manner. Interspecific contact was found to be reduced in the breeding seasons by: 1. Staggered times of emergence from hibernation so that the B. bufo season was almost complete by the time the B. calamita individuals entered the pools. 2. A preference by the individuals of the two species for different areas of the slacks for calling and egg laying purposes. 3. B. bufo were diurnal and B. calamita nocturnal. Hybrid mating was therefore rarer and it produced inviable spawn. The larvae of both species were present in the same pools but at different stages of development, and therefore probably had different food requirements. This was, however, thought to be the area of greatest interspecific conflict. Several morphological differences were noted between the larvae, and a means of larval identification was confirmed. In the non-breeding season, the two species seemed to prefer different habitats; B. calamita were found in less exposed situations with a variety of substrates and B. bufo were found in open areas, usually with a solid substrate. The North end of the Reserve was almost exclusively occupied by B. calamita during the non-breeding season. Both species became nocturnal after breeding was complete, and Natterjacks spent the days in burrows in dune ridges whereas Common Toads probably hid in vegetation and under objects. The Natterjacks were shown to have shorter hind limbs than Common Toads and this allowed increased, mobility on loose sand ridges, and facilitated digging. The physiological differences between the two species indicated a B. calamita adaptation to hotter conditions; this is also reflected by the more exclusively southern distribution of that species. The Natterjack larvae were tolerant of higher temperatures than common Toad larvae; at a given temperature the Common Toad larvae developed at a faster rate than the Natterjack larvae; Common Toad larvae were found id be more resistant to cold than Natterjack larvae. The adult Natterjack critical thermal maximum was 3.3°C higher than that of adult Common Toads. Other differences noted were the Common Toad adults were able to withstand greater desiccation than the Natterjack adults, and could also rehydrate at a faster rate; Natterjack adults and larvae were more tolerant to saline media than were the Common Toad adults and larvae. The significance of these tolerances in relation to the ecologies of the two species is discussed. The food intake of B. calamita and B. bufo adults was examined and certain differences in the importance of various food groups noted. Other topics covered include: breeding season population estimates and non-breeding season home range movements.

TI  - Trading heat and hops for water: Dehydration effects on locomotor performance, thermal limits, and thermoregulatory behavior of a terrestrial toad
AU  - Anderson, Rodolfo C. O.
AU  - Andrade, Denis V.
T2  - Ecology and Evolution
AB  - Due to their highly permeable skin and ectothermy, terrestrial amphibians are challenged by compromises between water balance and body temperature regulation. The way in which such compromises are accommodated, under a range of temperatures and dehydration levels, impacts importantly the behavior and ecology of amphibians. Thus, using the terrestrial toad Rhinella schneideri as a model organism, the goals of this study were twofold. First, we determined how the thermal sensitivity of a centrally relevant trait-locomotion-was affected by dehydration. Secondly, we examined the effects of the same levels of dehydration on thermal preference and thermal tolerance. As dehydration becomes more severe, the optimal temperature for locomotor performance was lowered and performance breadth narrower. Similarly, dehydration was accompanied by a decrease in the thermal tolerance range. Such a decrease was caused by both an increase in the critical minimal temperature and a decrease in the thermal maximal temperature, with the latter changing more markedly. In general, our results show that the negative effects of dehydration on behavioral performance and thermal tolerance are, at least partially, counteracted by concurrent adjustments in thermal preference. We discuss some of the potential implications of this observation for the conservation of anuran amphibians.

T2  - The Australian Zoologist
AB  - Groups of tadpoles of Limnodynastes peronii (Anura, Myobatrachidae) were kept at two temperatures (15 degrees C and 25 degrees C) for 45-105 days. In a thermal gradient (6-36 degrees C), initial thermal preferenda were significantly different in 15 degrees C and 25 degrees C history groups, approximately 13 degrees C and 21 degrees C respectively. However, after 2.5 hours these initial differences were no longer seen and the final thermal preferendum was approximately 18 degrees C regardless of previous thermal history. Critical thermal maxima and LD50, increased following warm thermal history. Considering these results and the lack of metabolic acclimation reported elsewhere, these tadpoles can be seen as ectotherms whose thermal strategies are behavioural rather than physiological or biochemical. The rapid loss of acclimation of preferred temperature is discussed in relation to Fry's "final preferendum" paradigm.

AB  - Montane neotenic Ambystoma tigrinum had lower critical thermal maxima (CTM) than desert neotenic A. tigrinum. In all other life history stages studied there were no differences in CTM between montane and desert populations. Comparison of life history stages in a desert population showed that larvae and neotenic adults had higher CTM than transformed animals or animals in the process of transforming. The CTM differences in life history stages reflects the potential thermal stresses to which these stages may be subject.

AB  - We used Critical Thermal Methodology to quantify thermal     tolerance of the crab-eating frog, Fejervarya cancrivora, from Hoga     Island, southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. The critical thermal maximum of     F. cancrivora was 42.1 ± 0.76 C, and is perhaps the highest thermal tolerance value known in an anuran acclimatized to 25 C. The frogs’ ability     to tolerate extreme high temperatures allows them to exploit abiotically     harsh mangal habitats and accounts for their wide distribution across the     tropical Pacific.

AU  - Nol

T2  - Copeia
AB  - Dissolved oxygen and temperature data from habitats frequented by the tadpoles of Rana pipiens and Bufo terrestris are related to laboratory studies of rates of oxygen consumption ( V̇ O2 ), Q10, critical oxygen tensions ( P c), and critical thermal maxima (CTM). Both species were acclimated to 22, 27 and 32 C for studies of physiological parameters. CTM was higher for both species in the earlier stages of development, and was higher in Bufo than in Rana at all temperatures. V̇ O2 was higher in Bufo tadpoles than in Rana. The P c increased with temperature in all stages of Bufo, but only in the younger stages of Rana. Field studies showed that Bufo tadpoles were found in warmer, more highly oxygenated microenvironments than were Rana tadpoles. It is suggested that shallow-water breeders, such as Bufo, emphasize adaptations to high temperatures, while permanent-water forms, such as Rana, emphasize adaptations to variations in oxygen availability.

AU  - Hoppe, David M.
T2  - Herpetologica
AB  - Tadpoles of piedmont Pseudacris triseriata at 2-legged and 4-legged stages have higher critical thermal maxima (CTMs) than montane tadpoles at corresponding stages. In both the piedmont and the montane tadpoles, CTMs are lower in the later stage of development, and CTMs during metamorphic climax correspond closely to published values for CTMs of adult chorus frogs. Critical thermal maximum appears to be an important adaptation of chorus frog tadpoles, and altitudinal differences in CTM among adult frogs may merely reflect the important differences in CTM which are expressed during the tadpole stages.

AU  - Cupp, Paul V.
T2  - Herpetologica
AB  - Critical thermal maxima (CTM) were determined at acclimation temperatures of 10, 20, and 30 C during larval development and metamorphosis in the frog and toad species Rana sylvatica, Pseudacris triseriata, Bufo americanus, Bufo woodhousei, and Gastrophryne carolinensis. Correlations were observed between geographic distribution and CTM, and breeding time and CTM for these species. In each species there was a significant decrease in CTM during metamorphosis. This was usually followed by an increase in CTM in adults. Adults usually had lower tolerance than larvae. The decrease in CTM during metamorphosis may reflect an adjustment downward in the thermal regime of a species so that metamorphosed young will be able to tolerate the low temperatures of winter. Tadpoles of B. americanus that were starved for 12 days had significantly lower CTM than those that were fed. Intraspecific differences in CTM were observed in tadpoles of G. carolinensis from different localities and in tadpoles of B. woodhousei collected from the same locality at different times. These differences may be due to differences in early thermal experience of embryonic stages.

The CTM of frogs acclimated to a cycled temperature regime of 10-30 C was the same as that for frogs acclimated to constant 30 C. Two-week unfed frogs had a lower thermal tolerance than frogs that had been fed daily. Larger individuals had a higher CTM. With a heating rate of 1 C/min, there was no difference in CTM of samples tested immediately after removal from acclimation temperatures compared to samples thermoequilibrated to 25 C for 1 hour after removal from acclimation.

AB  - Tadpoles of the tailed-frog, Ascaphus truei, exhibit distinct responses to temperature when placed in laboratory temperature gradients. Thermo-regulatory behavior is evidenced by an avoidance of temperatures above 22 C. Both first and second year tadpoles select over a wide temperature range (0-22 C), but first year animals tend to congregate below 10 C, whereas second year tadpoles aggregate above 10 C. Thermal acclimation had little influence on the preferendum of either year class, but photoperiod may alter the response of second year tadpoles to a temperature gradient.

AB  - Seasonal and latitudinal gradients in the thermal sensitivity of jumping performance have been examined in 10 species of hylids representing five different seasonal and distributional categories. Among temperate species, low-temperature performance is best in early-breeding northern species, intermediate in later-breeding northern species, and worst in southern species. Subtropical and tropical species have progressively higher critical thermal minima, but their thermal performance curves are not much different from those of southern temperate species in other respects. Critical upper thermal limits on jumping performance are much less variable than are lower limits, and the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) is not correlated with the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) in our sample. Effectively, CTmax is relatively inflexible, and consequently an improvement in low-temperature performance (reduction in L80, the lowest temperature at which frogs can attain 80% of maximal performance) results in a widening of the thermal breadth of performance at or above some arbitrarily selected standard (e.g., B80, 80% of maximal performance). The strong negative correlation between L80 and B80 in our sample of hylids is not found in lizards. Differences in thermal sensitivity of jumping performance are strongly correlated with naturally experienced minimum body temperatures. The thermal sensitivity of locomotion may itself be (or may be correlated with) a mechanism underlying distributional differences and temporal partitioning of habitat among frogs. We suggest that some aspects of the community organization of hylids, such as breeding phenology and the depauperate faunas of high latitudes, are constrained at least in part by thermal physiology. Ecological consequences of this constraint are currently being investigated.
